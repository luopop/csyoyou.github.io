If n is the x th digit of<br>the y th line with digits, with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim , then<br>• n is to be associated with a point situated x × 0.5 cm to the right and y × 0.5 cm below an origin,<br>• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right just in case n = 1 or n = 3, and<br>• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm below itself just in case n = 2 or n = 3.<br>The last digit on every line with digits cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and the digits on the last line with<br>digits cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which ensures that the input encodes a maze, that is, a grid of width<br>(x dim −1)×0.5 cm and of height (y dim −1)×0.5 cm (hence of maximum width 15 cm and of maximum<br>height 20 cm), with possibly gaps on the sides and inside. A point not connected to any of its neighbours<br>is thought of as a pillar; a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought of as part of a wall.<br>We talk about inner point to refer to a point that lies (x+0.5)×0.5 cm to the right of and (y+0.5)×0.5<br>cm below the origin with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim − 1 and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim − 1.<br>4.2 Output<br>If not run as either python3 maze.py –file filename.txt or as python3 maze.py -print –file<br>filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program should<br>print out a single line that reads<br>I expect –file followed by filename and possibly -print as command line arguments.<br>and immediately exit. Otherwise, if the input is incorrect, that is, does not satisfy the conditions spelled<br>out in the previous section, then the program should print out a single line that reads<br>Incorrect input.<br>and immediately exit.<br>4.2.1 When the program is run without -print as command-line argument<br>If the input is correct and the program is run as python3 maze.py –file filename.txt (where<br>filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program should output a first line<br>that reads one of<br>The maze has no gate.<br>The maze has a single gate.<br>The maze has N gates.<br>5<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a second line that reads one of<br>The maze has no wall.<br>The maze has a single wall that are all connected.<br>The maze has N sets of walls that are all connected.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a third line that reads one of<br>The maze has no inaccessible inner point.<br>The maze has a unique inaccessible inner point.<br>The maze has N inaccessible inner points.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fourth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no accessible area.<br>The maze has a unique accessible area.<br>The maze has N accessible areas.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fifth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no accessible cul-de-sac.<br>The maze has accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.<br>The maze has N sets of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, and a sixth line that reads one of<br>The maze has no entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.<br>The maze has a unique entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.<br>The maze has N entry-exit paths with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs.<br>with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.<br>• A gate is any pair of consecutive points on one of the four sides of the maze that are not connected.<br>• An inaccessible inner point is an inner point that cannot be reached from any gate.<br>• An accessible area is a maximal set of inner points that can all be accessed from the same gate (so<br>the number of accessible inner points is at most equal to the number of gates).<br>• A set of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected is a maximal set S of connected inner points<br>that can all be accessed from the same gate g and such that for all points p in S, if p has been<br>accessed from g for the first time, then either p is in a dead end or moving on without ever getting<br>back leads into a dead end.<br>• An entry-exit path with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs is a maximal set S of connected inner<br>points that go from a gate to another (necessarily different) gate and such that for all points p in<br>S, there is only one way to move on from p without getting back and without entering a cul-de-sac.<br>6<br>Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces. Note that your program should output no blank<br>line. For a given test, the output of your program will be compared with the expected output; your<br>program will pass the test if and only if both outputs are absolutely identical, character for character,<br>including spaces. For the provided examples, the expected outputs are available in files that end in<br>_output.txt. To check that the output of your program on those examples is correct, you can redirect<br>it to a file and compare the contents of that file with the contents of the appropriate _output.txt file<br>using the diff command. If diff silently exits then your program passes the test; otherwise it fails it.<br>For instance, run<br>python3 maze.py –file maze1.txt &gt;maze1_my_output.txt<br>and then<br>diff maze1_my_output.txt maze1_output.txt<br>to check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.<br>4.3 When the program is run with -print as command-line argument<br>If the input is correct and the program is run as If the input is correct and the program is run as<br>python3 maze.py -print –file filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores<br>the input) then the program should output some lines saved in a file named filename.tex, that can be<br>given as an argument to pdflatex to produce a file named filename.pdf that depicts the maze. The<br>provided examples will show you what filename.tex should contain.<br>• Walls are drawn in blue. There is a command for every longest segment that is part of a wall.<br>Horizontal segments are drawn starting with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with<br>the bottommost rightmost segment. Then vertical segments are drawn starting with the topmost<br>leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment.<br>• Pillars are drawn as green circles.<br>• Inner points in accessible cul-de-sacs are drawn as red crosses.<br>• The paths with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs are drawn as dashed yellow lines. There is a<br>command for every longest segment on such a path. Horizontal segments are drawn starting with<br>the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with those<br>segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm. Then vertical segments are drawn starting<br>with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with<br>those segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm.<br>Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces and blank lines. Lines that start with % are<br>comments; there are 4 such lines, that have to be present even when there is no item to be displayed of<br>the kind described by the comment. The output of your program redirected to a file will be compared<br>with the expected output saved in a file (of a different name of course) using the diff command. For<br>your program to pass the associated test, diff should silently exit, which requires that the contents of<br>both files be absolutely identical, character for character, including spaces and blank lines. Check your<br>program on the provided examples using the associated .tex files. For instance, run<br>7<br>python3 maze.py -print –file maze1.txt<br>and then<br>diff maze1.tex maze1_expected.tex<br>to check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.<br>5 Submission and assessment<br>5.1 Submission<br>Your program will be stored in a file named maze.py. After you have developed and tested your program,<br>upload your files using WebCMS. Assignments can be submitted more than once: the last version is<br>marked. Your assignment is due by October 2, 11:59pm.<br>5.2 Assessment<br>Up to 8 marks will reward correctness of solutions by automatically testing your program on some tests,<br>all different to the provided examples. Read carefully the part on program output to maximise your<br>chances of not failing some tests for stupid reasons. For each test, the automarking script will let your<br>program run for 30 seconds. Still you should not take advantage of this and strive for a solution that<br>gives an immediate output for any input.<br>Up to 2 marks will reward good comments, good choice of names for identifiers and functions, readability<br>of code, simplicity of statements, compactness of functions. This will be determined manually.<br>Late assignments will be penalised: the mark for a late submission will be the minimum of the awarded<br>mark and 10 minus the number of full and partial days that have elapsed from the due date.<br>The outputs of your programs should be exactly as indicated.<br>5.3 Reminder on plagiarism policy<br>You are permitted, indeed encouraged, to discuss ways to solve the assignment with other people. Such<br>discussions must be in terms of algorithms, not code. But you must implement the solution on your<br>own. Submissions are routinely scanned for similarities that occur when students copy and modify other<br>people’s work, or work very closely together on a single implementation. Severe penalties apply to a<br>submission that is not the original work of the person submitting it.<br></font>
