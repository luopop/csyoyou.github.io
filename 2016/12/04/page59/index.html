The two major tasks are outlined below.<br>Provided With:<br>You are given a file called Assignment1.java that contains a main method. Use this class to run<br>the code you write. Your code must work with this file; you cannot alter this file as a means of making<br>your code work. The marker will use a file similar to this to test the functionality of your code.<br>You are also provided two files called ThingToWriteFile.java and ThingToReadFile.java. These<br>classes are provided to make fileIO easier. Have a look at the code to understand how to use these<br>objects.<br>Two text files are included. One contains the country information (data.txt) and the other<br>contains the country/continent information (continent.txt). NOTE: Both of these files have a header<br>line!<br>On the last page of this assignment you are provided with an example output. Reference this for<br>text formatting.<br>You may assume all data is correct and that there are no errors in the data files (don’t worry<br>about exceptions, or validating inputs, etc.).<br>Stuff To Do:<br>1. Implement a Country class:<br>• The purpose of this object is to represent a country. This object will store some<br>important information about the country and will have a small number of simple<br>methods.<br>• This class will contain variables for the country name, population, area, and continent in<br>which it exists.<br>• You will need to write a constructor for the object. This constructor should take a name,<br>population, area, and continent as parameters.<br>• Write getter methods for the four instance variables (getName, etc.).<br>• Write a method called getPopDensity to return the country’s population density<br>(population/area).<br>• Write a single setter method for the population instance variable (setPopulation).<br>• Write a method called writeToFile which takes a ThingToWriteFile object as a<br>parameter. This method must write some country details to the provided<br>ThingToWriteFile object provided. Below is an example of how to print the details to<br>file (commas are important):<br>i. NAME, CONTINENT, POPULATION, POPULATION DENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada, North America, 34207000, 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a method printCountryDetails that prints some country details to the user:<br>i. NAME is located in CONTINENT has a population of POPULATION an area<br>of AREA and has a population density of GETPOPDENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada is located in North America has a population of 34207000, an area<br>of 9976140.0, and has a population density of 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a toString method which simply returns a string in this format (include a new line<br>character at the end):<br>i. NAME in CONTINENT<br>ii. Canada in North America<br>Test all your classes and methods before moving to the next section. Feel free to create other<br>helper methods if necessary.<br>2. Implement a CountryCatalogue class:<br>• The class should have a few important instance variables:<br>i. A final int called DEFAULT_SIZE which is equal to 5. This variable will be<br>used when the catalogue array is instantiated.<br>ii. A final int called NOT_FOUND which is equal to -1. This will be used as a flag<br>for some of our methods.<br>iii. A country array called catalogue which will store a bunch of countries.<br>iv. An int which stores the number of countries currently in the catalogue<br>v. A set of <strings> called continents. This set will store the continents. Don’t<br>know how to create a set in java? Look up the java docs, or just Google “Java<br>sets”. This set will make one of the below methods easier to implement.<br>vi. A <string, string=""> Map (dictionary) called cDict which will map a country name<br>to a continent. This will be used to make some of the below methods easier to<br>implement.<br>• Write the constructor (this gets a little complex). The constructor should:<br>i. Take two strings as parameters. One string will be the name of the file<br>containing the country information, and the other will be the name of the file<br>containing the continent information.<br>ii. Instantiate the instance variables.<br>iii. Read the country file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, create a Country object based on the text, and then add the Country to<br>the catalogue with a method called addCatalogue (more on this below). Be sure<br>to close the file when done.<br>iv. Read the continent file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, and then add the details to cDict and continents. Be sure to close the file<br>when done.<br>• Write a private method called addCatalogue which takes a country as a parameter. This<br>method only adds the provided country to the catalogue. However, we may have a<br>problem, the catalogue may be full! For this method, don’t worry about adding<br>duplicate countries.<br>• Write a private method called expandCapacity that will double the size of the catalogue<br>array. This method can be called by addCatalogue if there is no more room for a new<br>county to be added.<br>• Write a method called addCountry which takes a country as a parameter. This method<br>should add the provided country object to the catalogue and update the continents set<br>and cDict map. This method can call addCatalogue. For this method, don’t worry about<br>adding duplicate countries.<br>• Write a method getCountry that takes an index as a parameter and returns a Country<br>object from the indexed location in the catalogue. This method should return null if the<br>index provided is inadmissible.<br>• Write a method printCountryCatalogue which simply calls the toString method for each<br>Country currently in the catalogue instance variable.<br>• Write a method filterCountriesByContinent which will print out all the countries from a<br>specified continent (just use the county’s toString method). This method will take a<br>String representing the continent we want the countries from.<br>• Write a method searchCatalogue which takes a String of a name of a country we want<br>to find. This method will return an int representing the index of the found country in<br>catalogue. If the item is not in the list, return NOT_FOUND. Print some sort of<br>notification to the user if the country was not found.<br>• Write a method removeCountry which takes a String of a name of a country we want to<br>remove from the catalogue. This method can use searchCatalogue. Print some<br>notification to the user whether or not the item was successfully removed or not.<br>• Write a method setPopulationOfACountry which takes a String representing the name of<br>a country we want to alter and an int representing the new population. This method can<br>call searchCatalogue. Print some notification to the user whether or not the item was<br>successfully altered or not.<br>• Write a method saveCountryCatalogue which will write the catalogue’s county’s to file.<br>This method takes a String representing the name of the file we want to save the details<br>to. This method can simply call the Country’s writeToFile method.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithLargestPop which will return the index location of the<br>country with the largest population currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithSmallestArea which will return the index location of<br>the country with the smallest area currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method printCountriesFilterDensity which prints out some country details if the<br>country lies within some specified population density range. This method takes two<br>integers specifying the range inclusively (low and high). This method will have some<br>additional bookkeeping. See the example output provided below for a demonstration of<br>how this output should look.<br>• Write a method findMostPopulousContinent which prints out the continent, and the total<br>population of that continent (based only on the countries in the catalogue) of the<br>continent with the largest population. See the example output provided below for a<br>demonstration of how this output should look.<br>Test all your classes and methods. Feel free to create other helper methods if necessary.<br>FAQ:<br>• Q: How do I compare strings? Can I just use == ?<br>o A: NO! DO NOT USE ==!!!!!!!!!!! Comparing Strings in Java is… very weird actually<br>(and actually the subject of some debate). Use a method called equals instead. For<br>example:<br>? SomeString.equals(SomeOtherString) will be true if the Strings are the same.<br>• Q: Why can’t I use == then?<br>o A: It’s complicated. I’ll go into this later in the course.<br>• Q: I don’t know how to do X?<br>o A: Try going to www.google.ca and then typing X into the big text box.<br>• Q: How do we use Maps (dictionaries) in Java?<br>o A: The idea is similar to python, but there are some Java-isms here. First, check out the<br>java docs for Maps (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html</a>).<br>You’ll need to import the library they are defined in. Also, try looking up examples of<br>people using them. Instantiating them is a little weird (more details on this later in the<br>course, for now you’ll have to just type the magic code) (HINT for instantiation:<br>hashmap). Iterating through them is different too; try Googling how to iterate through a<br>map in java.<br>• Q: How do we use Sets in Java?<br>o A: Basically exactly the same answer above, but the java docs are different<br>(<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html</a>)<br>• Q: How do I parse a String in Java?<br>o A: Try looking up “splitting a string in java” with Google.<br>• Q: I swear I did everything right, but for some reason my files won’t open!<br>o A: This isn’t uncommon.<br>? If you’re using eclipse, try putting the .txt files in the project directory (the same<br>folder containing the bin folder, src folder.<br>? If you’re running from command line, try putting the files in the src folder.<br>Non-functional Specifications:<br>1. Include brief comments in your code identifying yourself, describing the program, and describing key<br>portions of the code.<br>2. Assignments are to be done individually and must be your own work. Software may be used to detect<br>cheating.<br>3. Use Java coding conventions and good programming techniques, for example:<br>i.  Meaningful variable names<br>ii. Conventions for naming variables and constants<br>iii. Use of constants where appropriate<br>iv. Readability: indentation, white space, consistency<br>Submit Country.java and CountryCatalogue.java. to OWL. Make sure you attach your .java files to your<br>assignment; DO NOT put the code inline in the textbox. DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR .class FILES. IF YOU<br>DO THIS, AND DO NOT ATTACH YOUR .java FILES, YOU WILL RECEIVE A MARK OF ZERO!<br>What You Will Be Marked On:<br>1. Functional specifications:<br>•  Does the program behave according to specifications?<br>•  Does it run with the main program provided?<br>•  Are your classes created properly?<br>•  Are you using appropriate data structures?<br>•  Is the output according to specifications?<br>2. Non-functional specifications: as described above<br>3. Assignment submission: via OWL assignment submission<br>Example output from provided Main.java:<br>Canada is located in North America has a population of 34207000, an area of 9976140.0, and has a population<br>density of 3.428881310807587<br>Target country not in catalogue.<br>England is located in Europe has a population of 54316600, an area of 130279.0, and has a population density of<br>416.9252143476692<br>Country “England” removed successfully.<br>Target country not in catalogue.<br>Country Catalogue:<br>China in Asia<br>United States of America in North America<br>Brazil in South America<br>Japan in Asia<br>Canada in North America<br>Indonesia in Asia<br>Nigeria in Africa<br>Mexico in North America<br>Egypt in Africa<br>France in Europe<br>Italy in Europe<br>South Africa in Africa<br>South Korea in Asia<br>Colombia in South America<br>Zambia in Africa<br>Ghana in Africa<br>Country with the largest population: China is located in Asia has a population of 1339190000, an area of<br>9596960.0, and has a population density of 139.5431469965489<br>Country with the smallest area: South Korea is located in Asia has a population of 50503933, an area of 98076.92,<br>and has a population density of 514.9420781158299<br>Countries in North America:<br>United States of America<br>Canada<br>Mexico<br>Countries with a population density between 0 and 25:<br>Brazil in South America<br>has a population density of 22.716728745947616.<br>Canada in North America<br>has a population density of 3.428881310807587.<br>Ghana in Africa<br>has a population density of 0.21889705799512446.<br>Continent with the largest population: Asia, with 1777655033,<br><br><br><br></string,></strings></font>
