Learning Goals<br>Learn how to<br>1. use associative containers like ​std::unordered_set​ and ​std::unordered_map<br>2. use iterators to iterate through associative containers<br>3. use ​algorithms​ that are available in the C++ Standard Library<br>4. pass command line arguments to a C++ program<br>5. partition a C++ program in header files (.hpp) and source files (.cpp)<br>6. read, understand, and use code written by other people<br>2. Description<br>In this assignment you’ll be doing the following:<br>1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.<br>2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews and<br>write the contents to a clean review file.<br>3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating of<br>the word.<br>4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews from<br>another file that doesn’t have any rating already.<br>5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.<br>2.1. Clean the data<br>The raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file named<br>rawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). The<br>following are interpretation of the rating values:<br>● 0 = Negative<br>● 1 = Somewhat Negative<br>● 2 = Neutral<br>● 3 = Somewhat Positive<br>● 4 = Positive<br>Each line of review follows the following format:<br><rating> <review><br>Example:<br>4 The Jungle Book is awesome!<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>where 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.<br>Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!<br>The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:<br>1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.<br>e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 words<br>namely “awe” and “inspiring”<br>3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.<br>e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |<br>“awesome!” |<br>4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.<br>e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”<br>5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that the<br>space character (‘ ’), tab (‘\t’), newline (‘\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For a<br>complete list of whitespace characters ​this​.<br>e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\n” becomes<br>“world”<br>6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.<br>7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.<br>8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the file<br>stopwords.txt<br>9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.<br>2.2. Fill the dictionary<br>Using the ​cleanReviewRatings.txt file, create a map/dictionary for every word that is found in<br>this file. The dictionary is of type<br>​<br>std::unordered_map<string, std::pair<long,="" long="">&gt;.<br>We associate a pair of values for each word namely its total_rating and its total_count. For<br>example, the word “fantastic” has occurred 3 times in the file ​cleanReviewRatings.txt with<br>associated ratings of 3, 4, and 3 (see the last 3 lines in the file). Therefore the word “fantastic”<br>gets a total_rating of 10 (i.e. 3 + 4 + 3 = 10) and a total_count of 3 since it had occurred 3 times<br>in the file. In a similar way, the other entries in this map are filled up as shown below. You may<br>want to read about a ​std::pair​ to understand more about how this map is organized.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>word total_rating total_count<br>fantastic  10  3<br>Zootopia  3  1<br>Dory  1  1<br>Finding  1  1<br>worst  0  1<br>The  6  2<br>inspiring  2  1<br>Jungle  8  2<br>Book  8  2<br>good  1  1<br>Jack  0  1<br>awesome  4  1<br>Lion  5  2<br>King  5  2<br>awe  2  1<br>Jill  0  1<br>2.3. Rate new reviews<br>Using the map/dictionary that we created in the previous step, we are going to read new unrated<br>reviews from a file (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​) and predict a rating for each review in this file. The<br>predicted rating for each review is written to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>How do we predict the ratings for the unrated reviews?<br>1. Read the input file with the unrated raw reviews (e.g. ​rawReviews.txt​).<br>2. Clean the data and produce an output file named ​cleanReviews.txt​. The process for<br>cleaning the data is exactly the same as we did in step 2.1.<br>3. Rate each review by finding the rating for each word from the map/dictionary that we<br>created in step 2.2. The rating for a line of review is the average value of the rating of all<br>the words in the review. If some word in this unrated review is not found in the<br>map/dictionary, then that word is given a neutral rating of 2. If a review is empty (i.e. the<br>review contains no words in it), then such a review is also given a neutral rating of 2.<br>e.g. Let see how we computed the rating for the 2nd review in ​cleanReviews.txt (i.e.<br>“The Lion King fantastic”). We lookup the map/dictionary that we created before and get<br>the average rating for each word in this review. The average ratings of each word in this<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>review is shown below:<br>The: 6/2 = 3<br>Lion: 5/2 = 2.5<br>King: 5/2 = 2.5<br>fantastic: 10/3 = 3.33<br>Based on these individual values, this line gets and average review of 2.83 as shown in<br>the file ​ratings.txt​.<br>Rating for this line = (3 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 3.33) / 4 = 2.83<br>We are dividing by 4 since this review contains 4 words in total.<br>Another example: “Finding Nemo great”<br>Finding: 1<br>Nemo: 2 (because it is NOT found in the map)<br>great: 2 (because it is also NOT found in the map)<br>Rating for this line = (1 + 2 + 2) / 3 = 1.67<br>4. Write the ratings for all the reviews to an output file named ​ratings.txt​.<br>A high-level process diagram of the steps explained in 2.1 - 2.3 is shown. Hope this<br>visualization helps you to understand the idea in a better way! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>That’s it! Now, after completing this step you may pat yourself on the back for doing an amazing<br>job with this assignment! :) Also, if you have not taken Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning<br>before then you have just now completed your first exercise in Machine Learning. You just<br>created a program that may predict the ratings of movie reviews based on some learning it did<br>before based on some reviews that already had ratings associated with them. Well, even though<br>our algorithm is very simple, this is the basic idea behind Machine Learning. Newcomers,<br>welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence! :)<br>3. Sample Output<br>If your program runs correctly without any errors, then NO OUTPUT will be written to the<br>console. If any input/output file cannot be opened, only then your program writes some error<br>messages to the console. All error handling is already taken care of in the file ​main.cpp​.<br>3.1. Small Data<br>INPUT FILES:<br>Rated Review File: ​rawReviewRatings.txt<br>Unrated Review File: ​rawReviews.txt<br>Stopwords File: ​stopwords.txt<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>OUTPUT FILES:<br>Cleaned Rated Review File: ​cleanReviewRatings.txt<br>Cleaned Unrated Review File: ​cleanReviews.txt<br>Ratings File: ​ratings.txt<br>3.2. “Big” Data<br>INPUT FILES:<br>Rated Review File: ​rawReviewRatingsBig.txt<br>Unrated Review File: ​rawReviewsBig.txt<br>Stopwords File: ​stopwords.txt<br>OUTPUT FILES:<br>Cleaned Rated Review File: ​cleanReviewRatings.txt<br>Cleaned Unrated Review File: ​cleanReviews.txt<br>Ratings File: ​ratings.txt<br>4. Important Details<br>1. The code for this assignment is split across 5 files.<br>a. main.cpp<br>b. a2.hpp<br>c. a2.cpp​ (This is the ONLY file you should modify!)<br>d. trim.hpp<br>e. trim.cpp<br>The .hpp files are the header files which contain only the declaration of the functions and<br>the .cpp files are the source files which contain the implementation of these functions. If<br>you want to understand more about why we have separate header and source files, then<br>maybe you should read ​this​.<br>2. Take some time to read the source code starting from the main() function that is present<br>inside the file main.cpp.<br>3. All the code you write for this assignment will only be inside the file ​a2.cpp. You should<br>not perform any file IO, print to stdout, or print to stderr in a2.cpp.<br>4. The files trim.hpp and trim.cpp are provided only to help you with trimming the<br>whitespaces in strings since doing so in C++ is not so easy as it’s in Java. You may read<br>these files to find out how to trim strings for this assignment.<br>5. You should use the following command to ​compile​​ your program.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>$ g++ <em>.cpp -std=c++11<br>where </em>.cpp means all the .cpp files are to be compiled. You need not mention the<br>names of the .hpp files since they are included from within the .cpp files. The option<br>“-std=c++11” informs the compiler that our may contain C++11 features (e.g.<br>std::unordered_map was introduced only in C++11).<br>6. Your program takes the two files ​rawReviewRatings.txt and ​rawReviews.txt as ​command<br>line arguments​. ​​You should run your program as shown below:<br>$ ./a.out rawReviewRatings.txt rawReviews.txt<br>If you don’t give these 2 command line arguments to your program, then the following<br>error message will be printed. This error handling is already handled for you in main.cpp.<br>$ ./a.out<br>USAGE: ./a.out <reviewratingsfile> <reviewsfile><br>7. If your program works correctly without any errors, then nothing is printed to the console.<br>Only the three output files cleanReviewRatings.txt, cleanReviews.txt and ratings.txt will<br>be produced. You may even try compiling and running your program before adding any<br>code in a2.cpp to see if these 3 output files are produced. The contents of these output<br>files will be empty until the methods in a2.cpp are implemented.<br>8. You should NOT add any new functions/methods in a2.cpp.<br>9. You ​SHOULD NOT MODIFY​​ any of the following in a2.cpp:<br>a. Names of the functions<br>b. Names and types of the parameters to a function.<br>c. Return types of the functions.<br>10.An approximate number of lines of code is given for each function in a2.cpp. These are<br>the number of lines for each function in Gerald’s implementation of a2.cpp. We have<br>provided this information since it may help you to see how little code you may write if you<br>make use of the C++ Standard Library effectively. This would help you to stop and think<br>for a while before you may write a lot of code by yourself and maybe later realize that<br>you could have used some functionality from the standard library to do the same thing<br>with little code and more effectively!<br>11.Updates to this specification that may be posted on piazza are also part of this<br>specification.<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br>5. Grading Scheme<br>Item  Grade<br>Correctness of your code  90<br>Code Style (indentation) &amp;<br>Implementation Comments in a2.cpp<br>10<br>TOTAL  100<br>6. Submission<br>Submit ​ONLY your a2.cpp​​ file at the following location:<br>/p/course/cs368-gerald/public/handin/<cslogin>/a2<br>Remember that ​no late work is accepted​​ in this course and there are no exceptions!<br>Hope you have a great time learning and coding associative containers and<br>algorithms using the C++ Standard Library! :)<br>CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016<br>Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Raj<br><br><br><br></cslogin></reviewsfile></reviewratingsfile></string,></review></rating></font>
