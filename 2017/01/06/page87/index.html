In this homework, we’ll finally finish the complete version of the game that pits you<br>against any number of other players, and includes provisions for taking more than one card each turn. In<br>the interest of brevity, you can refer to the descriptions of Homework 3 and Homework 4 for more<br>information about the game.<br>Background<br>For this assignment, we’ll start with a refactored version of the Homework 4 solution, that incorporates<br>one small change to the rules of the game 1 and significantly revamps the structure of the play() function.<br>Your job is to complete this refactored version to support taking more than one card per turn, where the<br>cards matched must sum to the value of the card played. So, for example, the solution to Homework 5 will<br>behave as follows (excerpt taken from the middle of a 3-player game):<br>Pl aye r 0 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 1] 7♠ (<em>3) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦, [4] 3♦<br>My hand : [0] 10♣, [1] 10♠<br>Pl ay wh i ch ca rd? 0<br>Se l ec t ma t ch i ng i nd ece s sepa r a t ed by spa c es (b l ank t o d i sca rd) : 1 4<br>Pl aye r 0 p l ays 10♣ and . . .<br>. . . . t ake s 3♦ f rom t ab l e<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 1 s t ash 7♠<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 1 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 2] 6♥ (</em>2)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 1 p l ays 6♦ and . . .<br>. . . . s t ea l s p l aye r 2 s t ash 6♥<br>=========<br>Pl aye r 2 :<br>St ash : [P l aye r 0] 10♣ (<em>5) , [P l aye r 1] 6♦ (</em>3)<br>Ta b l e : [3] 10♦<br>Pl aye r 2 add s 1♦ t o t ab l e<br>1<br>The small change referred to here has to do with what happens to the cards that remain on the table at the end<br>of the game. In the ‘‘real’’ version of the game, the last person to match cards from the table or another player’s<br>stash is gifted all of the remaining cards on the table when everyone else has finished playing their cards. This<br>change has been incorporated into the play() function.<br>1 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Note how Player 0 uses the 10♣ to match a 3♦ from the table and the 7♣ from Player 1’s stash (because<br>10 = 3 + 7).<br>As for HW4, to make this homework feasible, you will be provided a code skeleton containing nearly all<br>of the code you will need for the solution. Your assignment is to complete the functions getMove() and<br>pickMove(), but you should begin by studying the code skeleton file carefully.<br>def play(N=2, K=10)<br>The play() function has undergone the most significant reworking since the previous assignment. Aside<br>from an additional variable, which changes the parameters of the deck you play with, the big change is in<br>the main iteration that continues until the deck is exhausted. Previously, this loop was divided into two<br>sections: one for the human player and one for everyone else. The new structure merges these two<br>sections into a single loop and relegates the differentiation of the human player from the computer<br>player(s) to getMove(). The last change to play() involves assignment of any cards remaining on the table<br>to the last player who successfully matched, a job handled by the addition of a variable, last, that is reset<br>each time a player makes a match.<br>def getMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>The purpose of getMove() has changed significantly from HW4. In HW4, getMove() was to return a<br>single ‘‘best’’ move for a given (automated) player, where each move consisted only of matching a single<br>card from the player’s hand with a single card from the table or the top card from an opposing player’s<br>stash. But now that we permit matching a single card from the player’s hand with the sum of multiple<br>cards from the table or from the top of each opposing player’s stash, we need to generate and then<br>consider the space of all possible legal moves. Each move is represented as (c, M), where c is the index<br>into the player’s hand correspond to the card they will play and M is a list of indeces selected from the<br>table and/or the opposing player’s stashes such that sum(M)≡ H[i][c][0]. If (c, M) is (c,[]), then the<br>move corresponds to discarding c to the table.<br>Your job is to implement helper(c,v, j, M, L) to generate all legal moves, from which one will be<br>selected and returned as the value of getMove(). Let’s examine getMove() more closely:<br>(1)  The first step is to determine if the argument i relates to the human player (i ≡0). If so, then move<br>selection is relegated to pickMove().<br>(2)  The second step invokes the as-yet-unwritten helper function helper(c,v, j, M, L) repeatedly<br>(once for each card held by the current player) to generate the list L of all legal moves.<br>(3)  The third step returns a random card to discard if no legal moves were found.<br>(4)  The final step returns the legal move that maximizes the number of cards captured by the current<br>player (note that other heuristics might be used to make a ‘‘best’’ move selection from the list L of<br>legal moves).<br>The helper() function is a recursive function that constructs the set of legal moves. If you think of the<br>len(T) cards on the table and the up to N − 1 player stashes (excluding the current player’s stash) as<br>defining a space of size 2 len(T)+N−1 , you will need to enumerate the up to this many card combinations by<br>considering possible inclusion or exclusion of each successive card. The arguments to<br>helper(c,v, j, M, L) are designed to help you do so.<br>(1)  The first argument, c, is the index of the card you are trying to match from player i’s hand.<br>(2)  The second argument, v, initially the value of c, represents how many ‘‘points’’ remain to match<br>with the addition of each successive card. When this number reaches 0, you know the cards<br>you’ve selected so far sum to the original value you were trying to match.<br>2 Revised October 24, 2016<br>(3)  The third argument, j, initially 0, is the index of the card you are currently considering adding to<br>the legal move you are construction. On each successive recursive call, you’ll increase j by 1 to<br>indicate you are going to consider the next card, from 0 through N up to N + len(T) − 1. At each<br>recursive step, you will want to explore both adding the jth card to the current legal move or not<br>adding it.<br>(4)  The fourth argument, M, initially [], is the legal move under construction. Each time you elect to<br>include an additional card, you will need to extend M to include that card’s index.<br>(5)  The last argument, L, initially [], is the list of legal moves you have found so far. Each new leg al<br>move you discover should be added to L, and the updated L should be the value returned from<br>helper().<br>def pickMove(i, N, H, T, P)<br>pickMove() is called by getMove() when the first argument i to getMove() corresponds to the human<br>player. pickMove() interacts with the user to obtain a legal move (c, M). Note that pickMove() must<br>guarantee that the move is both legal in every sense and that the cards selected from the table and the top<br>of any opposing player’s stash do, in fact, sum to the value of the card selected from the player’s hand.<br>The Ground Rules<br>Because this class is part of the NSF study we have previously described to you, the ground rules may<br>differ slightly section by section. In your section, you will start working on your assignment in discussion<br>section and continue working on it in next week’s discussion section. We ask that you upload a partial<br>solution to ICON at the end of each session (this will not be graded, it is just to see how far you get during<br>the discussion section). You will also be asked to answer a short survey about your experience after each<br>discussion section. Once you upload your final solution to ICON (when the assignment is complete),<br>your will be asked to fill out a separate short survey about your work on the assignment.<br>Just as a reminder, under no circumstances should you turn in the work of someone else (including any<br>code or material you may find on the Internet) as your own, nor should you share your own work with<br>others. It is fine, however, to discuss general concepts with your classmates as long as these discussions<br>do not lead to the actual exchange of code fragments or written solutions.<br>You hav e several sources for help. Your first recourse should always be to post your question on the ICON<br>discussion board. This is the fastest place to go for clarifications or disambiguation, or for help with<br>Python in general (remember, don’t post your solution or any part of your solution). Second, if you must<br>share a portion of your code, you can always attend a TA help session (see the announcement on ICON<br>entitled General TA Office Hours start Thursday, September 1 for times and locations). You may also<br>attend my office hours Tuesdays from 1:30 to 3:30 in my office (14 MLH). Finally, you may email your<br>code with a specific question to me or to your TA, but please be sure that you include CS1210 on the<br>subject line (also, this is the slowest way of getting help, due to the volume of mail we are likely to<br>receive).<br>What to Hand In<br>As before, for credit, you must make sure your function definitions exactly match the ‘‘signatures’’ giv en<br>in this problem specification. Your files should be uploaded to the HW5 dropbox folder in ICON by the<br>specified time and date: late assignments will not be accepted.<br>You should start building your solution file according to the template at the end of this assignment (the<br>template file, hw5.py, can be downloaded from ICON), substituting your own name for mine, obviously.<br>obviously. Note that the template file is incomplete and will not load in its present state.<br>3 Revised October 24, 2016<br>Make sure that you follow the instructions given for each function exactly, as the autograder expects these<br>functions to follow the naming convention shown. Also note the use of the comment character, #, at the<br>beginning of each line that is not intended to be interpreted by Python. You should use comments liberally<br>to explain what you are doing to the human reader.<br>4 Revised October 24, 2016<br><br><br><br></font>
