In this game, one participant tries to guess a four-digit passwordknown to the other participant, receiving feedback on each guess as described below.2 OverviewIn this lab, you will implement a networking version of the hacking mini game, which willcomprise of two C++ programs, one client and one server. This lab will help you to gainexperience with socket programming using Berkeley socket interface. In order to focus moreon the details of socket programming part, the game and most of the command parsing areprovided as a skeleton code.This lab is worth for 60 points. This lab is due no later than 23:59 Monday, Oct 3. No latesubmission will be accepted.3 SpecificationIn this lab, you are required to implement a client and a server program for the ”hacker”game. The server program and client program will interact by exchanging messages tosimulate the game play. A simple message/packet format is provided in the file: message.h.The server and client program will handshake through TCP and the gaming interaction willuse UDP.3.1 “Hacker” GameThe game will display a list of possible passwords (formatted in a way to mimic what is seenin the Fallout game series). The user will then enter a guess for which one they believe thepassword to be. The game will report back the “likeness” of the guess (how many correctletters are in the correct position).1For example, suppose the password is ”FULL” and the displayed text, containing all of thepossible passwords, is:ROBCO INDUSTRIES (TM) TERMALINK PROTOCOLENTER PASSWORD NOWThe default number of attempts is set to 4.A demo of the ”hacking” game play can be found at: [Demo Play]-In the demo, click the power button in the right lower corner then click on the phase thatyou would like to guess as the password.3.2 The Server ProgramExample invocation: ./serverThe server program will create a TCP socket and will then wait for an incoming TCPconnection. This TCP socket’s port will be assigned by the operating system and will beprinted to the console. We assume that the client knows this TCP port number, because theclient is started after the server. When the server receives an incoming TCP connection, itcreates a UDP socket, whose port is also assigned by the OS. Via the TCP socket, the serverprogram returns a packet to the client containing the UDP port number. This can be doneusing the UDP Cntr MSG type found in message.h.Once the UDP connection is established, the server program initializes a variable of typeHackerGame. The initialization of this variable generates the server password, a list ofpossible passwords, a string to act as the display board for the game, and the numberof attempts left. These are accessible through functions in the HackerGame class. Werecommend that you look over HackerGame.h. Guesses from the client can be evaluated by2using the TestEntry() function. The server keeps receiving and testing guesses from theclient until either the number of attempts has been exhausted or the password is guessedcorrectly. For each guess, the server sends a packet containing the “Likeness” of the guessto the client using the UDP socket. Once the game is over, either by guessing the passwordcorrectly or running out of attempts, the server must notify the client using the UDP socket,after which the server closes both the TCP and UDP sockets.3.3 The Client ProgramExample invocation: ./client -h lenny.cse.msu.edu -p 48192The client program is required to accept the following arguments.• -h is the server address (domain name).• -p is the TCP port number on which the server listens for an incoming connection.The client resolves the server address by using gethostbyname() and connects to the serverover TCP. The client then receives a packet from the server containing the UDP port number.Using the UDP port number, the client sends a confirmation message to the server, lettingit know that it can send the first game message, using the UDP socket. The client receives apacket containing the game display text and prints it to console. The client then takes inputfrom the user for the a guess at the password and sends the guess to the server program viathe UDP socket. For each guess the client should receive a response containing the likenessof the guess and how many attempts are left. These are to be printed to console.The client should monitor the content of each game message for ending conditions. Specif-ically, if AttemptsLeft = 0 or IsGameWon = true, then the client should print to consoleeither “Terminal Locked Out!” or”Access Granted!”, respectively. The client then closesboth the TCP and UDP sockets.3.4 Packet Format: message.hThere are two different types of packets for this lab; both are defined in message.h.1. UDP Cntr MSG: which contains only one field: int port2. Game MSG: which contains:(a) char Display[1000](b) int AttemptsLeft(c) bool IsGameWon(d) int Likeness3(e) char Entry[10]String type variables cannot be used in these packets due to how they utilize memory. Forinformation to be correctly sent in packets, the packet most know the starting address of thevariable and how large it is. Hence why we use arrays of chars.You may want to still use strings in your client and server programs, however. Following aretwo examples of copying content between the two variable types.Copying char array to a string:char Word1[10] = “test”;string Word2(Word1); //Word2 now contains “test”Copying a string to a char array:string Word2 = “test”;char Word1[10];strcpy(Word1, Word2.c str()); // Word1 now contains “test”4 DeliverablesYou will submit your lab using the web based handin utility. Don’t use the command-linebased handin facility. Please submit all files in your project directory. If you start your labwith the skeleton code, submit all files, even if the file is not modified.This lab is due no later than 23:59 Monday, Oct 3. No late submission will be accepted.The compilation must be done using a makefile. The code should compile on multiplemachines (can use lenny, carl, bart, etc). Please do not do your debugging on the servers(arctic or black). You will not be awarded any points if your submission does not compileusing a makefile. A sample makefile will be provided. It will only have to be changed if youadd more files to your solution. Please test your programs before handing them in.A README file is required including your name, PID, and machines that you tested on.You will run your server and client programs and paste the output in your README file.A sample README file is also included in the skeleton code. You are also encouraged toinclude explanations about parts of your code that may not work in the README file.5 ExampleFollows is an example of output from the client and server.

You must not modify the existing method headers as we use them to test your code,however you may add any additional methods you believe are necessary.Your task is to write the methods readSize, readSquare, validColumn, validRow, andvalidLatinSquare as described in the skeleton code. Your complete program will include the givenskeleton code and the methods that you will write.Your code will be tested at the method level, which means each method will be tested individually, not justby running the main method. This means you need to make sure that each method works exactly as thedocumentation in the skeleton code describes.See below for some example outputs of the main method being run. The text in black is required output, andthe text in green is user input.INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20162Please enter the size of the square (N):3Please enter 9 numbers:1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 2This is the square you input:+‐+‐+‐+|1|2|3|+‐+‐+‐+|2|3|1|+‐+‐+‐+|3|1|2|+‐+‐+‐+It’s a Latin square!Please enter the size of the square (N):3Please enter 9 numbers:0 2 1 1 0 2 2 1 0This is the square you input:+‐+‐+‐+|0|2|1|+‐+‐+‐+|1|0|2|+‐+‐+‐+|2|1|0|+‐+‐+‐+Not a Latin square!Please enter the size of the square (N):2Please enter 4 numbers:1 2 3 4This is the square you input:+‐+‐+|1|2|+‐+‐+|3|4|+‐+‐+Not a Latin square!Please enter the size of the square (N):3Please enter 9 numbers:1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3This is the square you input:+‐+‐+‐+|1|2|3|+‐+‐+‐+|1|2|3|+‐+‐+‐+|1|2|3|+‐+‐+‐+Not a Latin square!AssumptionsYou can make the following assumptions for this task: Your code will only be given sensible input (e.g. ? ? 0). Any inputs will be given as integers only; you do not need to worry about invalid inputs like floatingpoint numbers or Strings.How to Submit in PASTAWriting your code1. In Eclipse, create a project “info1103_task2”. In this project, create a package “squares”, and then aclass “LatinSquares” within the package.2. Download the skeleton code from PASTA and either import the class or paste the code into the class“LatinSquares.java”.3. Write the required methods. You may not change any method headers in the skeleton code! Yourprogram consists of the provided skeleton code and the methods that you wrote. Compile and runyour program and make sure that it produces the same output as the example output. When you arehappy with your program, you need to submit it on PASTA.INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20163Submitting in PASTA1. Log in to PASTA (http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/) with your Unikey login and password.Note: If you are off-campus, you will need to establish a VPN connection to access PASTA. This meansinstalling a program called “VPN client” on your computer and running it every time when you use PASTAoff-campus. Instructions how to do this are available here:http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-access-the-university-network%3FIf you have problems with VPN, try synchronising your password:https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/If this doesn’t work, contact the ICT helpdesk: http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/2. Find Task 2 and press “Submit”. Then press “Choose File” and attach the LatinSquares.javafile, then press “I accept” (after reading the University policy on academic honesty).3. If you see a message indicating that your code is queued for testing under Task 2, this means thatyour code has been uploaded successfully.4. If you see a red error box, you need to fix any problems indicated before your submission will beaccepted.5. Once your program has been tested, the page will tell you to refresh for results, so refresh the page.You should see green, red and grey boxes. Each box corresponds to a test; a red box indicates thatyour program has failed the respective test, a green box indicates that your program has passed thetest, and a grey box indicates that the test is hidden (you will not see the result of the test until afterthe due date).6. If you have red boxes, you can see which tests were not passed by clicking on the task name. Correctthe errors (go to Eclipse, re-write your code and test it carefully) and then submit again in PASTA.7. For further help on using PASTA, check the INFO1103 User Manual, or post a question on Piazza.MarkingYour mark is the percentage of the tests that you have passed, e.g. for Task 2: all 20 tests passed, themark is 100% of 5 marks = 5 marks, 10 tests passed, the mark is 50% of 5 marks = 2.5 marks.You can submit as many times as you want. Please make sure that your program compiles and runsbefore you submit it in PASTA. Your last submission will be the one that will be marked.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"C#代写： Exemption exam for ECS 102 - Java","slug":"page68","date":"2016-12-19T03:07:34.000Z","updated":"2017-01-11T08:20:34.224Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/19/page68/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/12/19/page68/","excerpt":"","text":"Introductionjava的基础知识考试，考察了基本的java语法RequirementExemption exam for ECS 102 - Java The goal of this exam is to give recognition for programming you already know, so you can fulfill a requirement and move on to learning something new.

All assignments will have tobe developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 using C# as theprogramming language. No other languages will be accepted. Thisassignment contributes to 10% of your overall grade. You mustdemonstrate this assignment to your lab tutors during your scheduled labsession in week 5. Note that you also need to submit your code onBlackBoard before 11:59pm Sunday 28/08/2016.This assignment is divided into 3 tasks:• Creating an ASP.Net Web Application using Web Form (2 Marks)• Performing basic calculator operations and converting the result from base-10to base-2 (5 Marks)• Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3 Marks)Please Note INFS7204 students will have to complete all three tasks,while INFS3204 students only need to complete the first two with 3Marks for Task 1 and 7 Marks for Task 2.• Preparation• Before attempting to do this assignment, you should have a basicknowledge of how to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 to createASP.NET Web Forms, as well as a basic knowledge ofprogramming with C#. Please note that you need to choose .NETFramework 4.6 for your assignments. You also need to haveWindows 7 (or later versions) installed on your computer.• Hints: Please be advised that the design and implementation of thisassignment is totally up to you. However, you may need to ensurethat you are familiar with the concept of ‘Recursive Functions’ anddefining ‘Global Variables’ to implement some parts of thisassignment.• Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Free Download: If you would liketo install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on your own computer,as a student, you can download it for free from the following links:https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspxhttps://beta.visualstudio.com/download-visual-studio-vs/Task 1: Creating an ASP.NET Web Application (2 Marks)Create a Calculator Web Application with Web Form, which consists ofthe following elements:• Two TextBoxes for the user’s inputs• A DropDownList for the user’s choice of operation• Two Labels that indicate the result’s base system (i.e. base-10 orbase-2)• Four TextBoxes for displaying the calculating results and countingresults.• Two Buttons to submit the form and get the resultYour final application should look like the example below. However, youmay decide to design and implement this application more interestingly.Please note that you are not required to validate the user’s input for thisassignment.Task 2: Performing basic calculator operations andconverting the result from base-10 to base-2 (5 Marks)In order to complete this task, you need to implement the basic calculatoroperations (i.e. +, -, *, /). When user enters two numbers and clicks on theCalculate button, the result of the operation should be displayed in thebase-10 output TextBox. Additionally, the result needs to be convertedfrom base-10 to base-2 system and be displayed in the base-2 outputTextBox.For example, if user inputs 34+56, it calculates 34+56=90, the base-2conversion number of 90 is 1011010. Please see the following picture:Task 3: Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3Marks)In this task, you need to count the number of “0”s and “1”s in the base-2calculation result. When the calculation of Task 2 is done and user clickson the Count button, the number of “0”s and “1”s need to be displayed intwo output TextBoxs.For example, as you can see in the following picture, the number of “0”sin 1011010 is 3, and the number of “1”s in 1011010 is 4.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C#","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"}]},{"title":"Java代写： AP Assignment 1 s2 2016","slug":"page66","date":"2016-12-15T23:06:55.000Z","updated":"2017-01-11T07:55:16.124Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/16/page66/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/12/16/page66/","excerpt":"","text":"Introductionjava实现一个旅行售票管理系统，这个题主要考察学生的java基础知识，编程逻辑能力，类的设计和OOP知识，功能点比较多，细节点也比较多。RequirementCOSC1290/1295 Advanced Programming / Java for C ProgrammersSchool of CS and IT, RMIT UniversityAssignment 1 – Semester 2 2016 – UPDATEDDue date: 5.00pm, September 12, 2016IntroductionYou are required to implement a basic Java program using Java SE 7.0 or above.This assignment is designed to help you:1. Test your knowledge of basic Java concepts;2. Evaluate your ability to design programming logic;3. Practise your knowledge of class design and OO constructs in Java;4. Practise error handling in Java;5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.This is an individual assignment and worth 15% towards your final grade..Academic Integrity (more)The submitted assignment must be your own work. No marks will be awarded for any partswhich are not created by you.Plagiarism is treated very seriously at RMIT. Plagiarism includes copying code directly fromother students, internet or other resources without proper reference. Sometimes, studentsstudy and work on assignments together and submit similar files: this may be regarded asplagiarism.Please note that you should always create your own assignment even if you have very similarideas. Plagiarism-detection tools will be used for all submissions. Severe penalties may beapplied in cases of plagiarism, including loss of all marks or, in repeat cases, expulsion fromthe course.At any point, but especially during the scheduled lab-demonstrations, you may be required toshow and explain your design and code to any of the teaching staff.General Implementation Details All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should beprinted to the standard output. There is no need to use files all. If the input is formatted incorrectly the execution should stop immediately and anappropriate error message should be displayed. Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classesproperly—i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longerthan 50 lines. Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Yourcoding style should be consistent with standard Java coding conventions(https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) Your programs will be marked on RMIT UNIX machines using Java SE 7.0. Makesure you test your program on these machines before you submit. Further hints, tips and details, including submission instructions, will be made viaBlackboard and in lectures.Overall SpecificationYou will implement an electronic ticket for public transport, called MyTi (My Ticket). A MyTi can be “charged” by adding credit to it: initially, a MyTi has zero credit; a MyTican hold up to $100 of credit. Any attempt to add credit that goes above the limit causes an error message and for thecharge to fail. Amounts to be credited to a MyTi must be integer dollar amounts in precise multiples of$5.00. Travel Passes can be bought using a MyTi ticket: a pass can be for either “2 Hours” or“All Day”, and can be for either “Zone 1” or “Zone 1 and 2”. Prices are as follows:o 2 Hour Zone 1 pass: $3.50o 2 Hour Zone 1+2 pass: $5.00o All Day Zone 1 pass: $6.90o All Day Zone 1+2 pass: $9.80 If you attempt to purchase a travel pass without sufficient credit on your MyTi ticket thenthe attempt fails: no ticket is issued and there is no charge to your ticket.Your system must handle multiple MyTi tickets, each with its own unique id—the id will beused to identify which MyTi ticket is being used / charged / etc.Journeys and Travel PassesThe MyTi system is designed to automatically combine multiple Journeys in a day by oneUser into the cheapest Travel Pass that covers those Journeys. For example, if a User travelstwice inside 2 hours, then a 2 Hour pass is purchased. However, if the user travels again laterin the day, the 2 Hour pass may be turned into an All Day pass if that is cheaper than 2 2-Hour passes.Each time the user asks for a new Journey, the previously purchased Travel Pass should bechecked:1. If the current Travel Pass is an All Day and we are in the day and the pass covers thejourney zones, then a new Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;2. If the new Journey fits inside the 2 Hours of the current Travel Pass, then a newTravel Pass does not need to be purchased;3. If the current Travel Pass is a 2 Hour and the new Journey is outside that time, then anew 2 Hour Pass needs to be purchased.TravelPass objects should store the information needed for all decisions described above(e.g. whether to add a new Journey into an existing TravelPass).To purchase a Travel Pass take a Journey, the system user must be prompted for:- The id of the MyTi card is to be charged to be used;- the day of travel, the start time and the end time;- the starting Station and end Station of the journey.BONUS: The above means that users may spend more on Travel Passes than they needed to:e.g., they may end up buying multiple 2-hour travel passes instead of one All Day pass. Abonus task is implement logic that always results in the cheapest Travel Pass options:1. IF the new Travel Pass means that all that day’s Passes would add up to cost morethan a All Day Pass—then all the Passes for that day are replaced by a single All DayPass; in this case the MyTi card is charged the difference between what has alreadybeen paid that day, and what an All Day Pass would cost.2. You have to do similar thinking about when different Journeys are in different Zones!I’ll leave that to you to think about If you try to purchase a Journey that requires a new Travel Pass, or an upgrade from 2 Hourto All Day, and there is not enough credit left on their MyTi card, then the purchase of thatJourney must fail (with an Exception), and the user told they need to recharge their card.UsersA MyTi ticket can be associated with one unique User. The MyTi ticket needs to store detailsof its user, such as name and email address. A User needs to have access to their MyTi card.Day and TimesTo make things easier (and to run demos in less than real time!) you will type in the day andtimes of Journeys (rather than using a System call to get them automatically). Using a “24hour” time representation should make it easy to determine the length of Journeys. Note thata Journey fits inside a 2 Hour pass if it ends before the end of the 2 Hour period. An All Daypass covers all journeys that start inside that day and runs from midnight to 23:59pm.StationsStations have a unique name and each Station can tell which Zone it is in.Admin FunctionsYou also need to implement the following system administration functions:- On request, print all TravelPasses purchased on all MyTi cards. This list shouldordered by card id. For each TravelPass, list the Journeys that were in it;- Print usage statistics for all Stations: i.e., how many journeys started at each Station,how many finished at each Station;- Create a new User: this requires input of a new id (the operation fails if it is already inuse), name, type (Adult, Junior, Senior), and email address.Program DevelopmentWhen implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highlyrecommended that you build your program incrementally.This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed toboth help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You arenot strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity.Part A (1 mark): Extend existing codeSample code implementing the outline of menu-based main program will be made available.1. Design the TravelPass class to contain all data and operations it needs (e.g. the Zoneand Duration; Day and Start/End times);2. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors. These may include: trying topurchase a pass without having enough funds; recharging by an invalid amount;invalid menu options or inputs, etc.Part B (1 mark): Class DesignDefine all the classes and interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, youshould try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This maymean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer).At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write thedefinitions, not all the code.You will be submitting or demonstrating your class design in tutes or labs before thedue date. Details will be announced in lectures and on Blackboard.Part C (3 marks): Main ProgramYour main program should be in a class called MyTiSystem. (Of course, any class cancontain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program contains a menu thatoffers the following options in a loop:1. Buy a Travel Pass using a MyTi card2. Recharge a MyTi card3. Show remaining credit for a MyTi card4. Purchase a Journey using a MyTi card5. Print all Journeys made using all MyTi cards6. Show Station statistics7. Add a new User8. QuitSince we managing multiple MyTi cards, we have to enter a card’s id to know which MyTiticket to charge for a travel pass.Part D (4 marks): Implement Core FunctionalityImplement the core functionality of the MyTi system described above, except for thecomplex decision-making around deciding whether a journey fits inside an existingTravel Pass—i.e. in this version, just have the system buy a 2 Hour Travel Pass for eachJourney. You should be able to implement the rest of the MyTi functionality described above,and run and test your systemPart E (1 marks): Include Multiple Journeys in Travel PassesImplement the logic that decides whether a new Journey fits inside an existing Travel Pass orwhether the user needs to buy a new Travel Pass for that Journey.Demos (1 mark each – 2 marks total)You are required to demonstrate your progress and final solution to the teaching staff twice.Details will be made available during lectures and on Blackboard.Other (3 marks)Marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity,meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures andother design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and labassistants, or with the coding mentors.Bonus (1.5 marks each) Implement logic, or “business rules”, for combining Travel Passes so that the user ischarged the cheapest Travel Pass that fits their day of travel. You are welcome to discussthe logic and different conditions via Blackboard Discussion boards; however, everystudent must implement the final Java solution by themselves. There will be another bonus task announced later on for students that would like tochallenge themselves further.Test DataYour program MUST include the following test items: just create them in your main programand use them to populate your data structures that keep track of all such items. These will beused to test/mark your program so it’s crucial that you enter them. You may add further Usersand Stations if you wish, but you must add at least the ones below. Users (id, type, name, email)o lc, Lawrence Cavedon, lawrence.cavedon@rmit.edu.au Stations (name, zone)o Central, 1o Flagstaff, 1o Richmond, 1o Lilydale, 2o Epping, 2Sample Test RunsSample runs demonstrating behaviour of the system will be provided on Blackboard.SubmissionAssignment submission will be via Blackboard, by 5.00pm, Monday September 12 2016.You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Eachsubmission will overwrite any previous submissions.1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format).2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Blackboard. Your progress willbe taken into consideration in marking. Further details will follow.3. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program,what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know doesnot work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem runningyour program and the README does not help then you will lose marks.4. There will also be demos for this assignment. You will be asked to demonstrate yourprogress and/or explain your design. Details of the demo will be announced onBlackboard and in lectures.5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission(do not submit any *.class files!). Your code must on under RMIT UNIX machines.6. Late final submissions will incur a penalty of 10% per day. Submissions made 5 daysafter the due date will receive no marks.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"Python代写： ass4","slug":"page65","date":"2016-12-15T03:56:57.000Z","updated":"2017-01-11T07:51:13.084Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/15/page65/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/12/15/page65/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction用python实现二叉搜索数的功能，在原来的模板基础上，增加题目要求写的方法，实现功能并且最后完成测试RequirementYou may begin this assignment with the sample BST code.Add the following functionality to the code:1. Modify the code so that each node stores not only a number (which is used as the sort value (or “key”) of the node), but also a string containing the name of a person. So, the root node of a BST may contain for its data: [40, “Wendy”], the left child of the root may be [18, “Carol”]. Modify all functions that this change affects.2. Add a function called “changeLeaves” which changes the person’s name contained in the leaf nodes to “Leif”. Recall that a leaf node is one that has no children. Your function should take one parameter, the root of a BST, and it should return the root of the (changed) tree.3. Add a function called “countNodes” that counts the number of nodes that contain names starting with “w” or “W”. Your function should take one parameter, the head of a BST and it should return the number of nodes matching the given condition.4. Add a function called “printReverse” that prints all the nodes in reverse order. That is, the node with the largest numerical value is printed first and the node with the smallest numerical value is printed last. Your function should take as a parameter the root of a BST and it should return nothing.5. Write a function that will convince the TA that your code works. Be sure to explain what you are showing. You should cover special cases such as empty trees.What to SubmitSubmit a single file containing your entire program. DO NOT ZIP THE FILE. You do not need to include the data file. We will test your program on a different grid.Be sure you document your program appropriately. Each function should include a header comment explaining what the function does, what the parameters are and what it returns.MarkingThe assignment will be marked using a rubric.

This means you must spendmore time on the reflections, design and test documents. The grader will not be able to askyou questions. If the grader has a question that is not answered in your supplieddocumentation then you will likely lose points.You will create a program that will enable the user to move through a maze. The mazewill contain locked doors that require keys to be opened. Guarding the maze are rovingkiller swans. The player isn’t completely defenseless as swans aren’t able to harm aplayer who has recently consumed an apple. To escape the maze, the player mustnavigate through the maze, swans, and doors until they reach a ladder. Each maze levelcontains one ladder that takes the player to the next level of the maze until the final levelis reached. On the final level there is an exit instead of a ladder.Baba Yaga is back! She has captured the player. Her soulless minion didn’t lock thedoor correctly so the player can try to escape. She uses killer swans as the guards. Eachlevel starts with one swan. Baba Yaga knows the player has left the cell but can onlysummon one new swan at a time. For every 30 steps the player takes, a new swan willrandomly appear on the current level.The player will also encounter apples lying around the maze. The player can pick up andcarry up to two apples at a time. As long as the player has an apple in their inventory,they may stop and eat it in order to render them invulnerable to swans for the next 15steps.Your code will implement this game as follows:You will start your game with a single command line argument. This will be an integervalue that indicates the number of levels. The floor files will be named floor_# where #indicates which floor it holds. Your program will always start reading with the first floor.An example of running the game with a maze that has 3 floors:./maze 3 (assumes name of first floor is: floor_1)The maze is defined by a set of text files, each of which contains a single level.Whenever the game starts or the player reaches a new level, that data must be read fromthe appropriate text file. The first line of each file will have two integer values whichdescribe the number of rows and columns for that level. You must use this to create adynamic array of that size and then read in the data for the level. Perform inputvalidation on all characters in the file as you read them. Do not load the file and informthe user there is a problem.The following characters or symbols describe objects in the levels:‘#’- walls‘D’- door‘L’- Ladder‘P’- Player‘S’- Swan (the starting location of the first swan)‘K’ Key‘A’- Apple‘E’- Starting location for each level‘X’- Exit(one way out)‘ ‘- empty space (blank character)You must concatenate the file name with the new floor number. You will not use anarray of filenames? HINT: This will require string streams.You must display that level to the user. Then you will accept the following commandsfrom the user:‘w’ move up‘a’ move left‘s’ move down‘d’ move right‘e’ eat apple‘u’ use ladder‘q’ quitEach input from the user must be validated before any action takes place. After eachcommand, you will update the array, then print the current status of the game to thescreen. Each command is one “step” which you will use to coordinate movement andsummoning of the swans.You will update the position of the player and all swans after every move entered by theplayer. The K (key) and A (apple) symbols will be removed from the maze after theplayer picks them up. The D (door) is removed once the player enters that space with akey. To move between floors, the player must get to the space with the ladder. On thefinal level the player must reach the X to exit the maze and make their escape.The position of each Actor (Swan or Player) will not be stored in the array. It will bestored in the Player or Swan object. When you read in the initial floor array the ‘S’should be changed to a blank character. When you display the floor after each move youwill print the array, adding a ‘P’ or ‘S’ as appropriate for each Actor.Movement- To move around a level the players must use the ‘W’, ‘A’. ‘S, and ‘D’ keys.Your move function should prevent them from moving through walls, or a door if theydon’t have a key. If the player has a key then they can move through a door. Simplyremove a key from the player and convert the D space to an empty space assuming theuser has at least one.When the player gets to a ladder space they climb it with a ‘U’ command. The Echaracter designates where the player starts on the new level. Time (i.e. the number ofsteps) is reset on each new level. When the player moves from the starting space, the Emust remain. If a swan catches a player, their location must be changed to the E square.After each move, the updated maze must be displayed for the user.When the player moves into a space that contains a key (‘K’) they pick up the key to addit to their inventory. When a player moves into a space with an apple (‘A’) they pick itup. A player can hold no more than 3 keys and they can carry only 2 apples. If they entera space and cannot hold the key or apple it remains in that space. The player can use anapple by eating it (‘E’). This makes the swans ignore the player for the next 15 turns,decreases the apples the player has by 1, and takes an entire step/turn (i.e. they don’tmove that step).Swans (10 points): The Swans will be similar to the Player, except they move randomly.They cannot move through walls or doors. They will ignore apples on the ground. If aswan is in a square adjacent to the player, the player will be moved back to the startingspace for that level. The swans cannot move between levels. For every 30 steps the playertakes, place a new swan at a random valid location in the current level.Classes. You will need the following classes:Game class- dynamic array for current floor, array of pointers to actors, int total#_floors,int current_floor, function to read in floors from a fileFloor class- char [][] tiles, void print to screen, constructorActor class: ABSTRACT- int row, int column, char symbol, virtual moveSwan class (inherits Actor)- move (automated),Player class (inherits Actor)- move (prompt for WASD), keys(s), hold up to 3 keys, holdup to 2 apples(You will need a function to send the player back to the start if a swan movesadjacent to their position. Where do you put that function?)You must include a makefile and put all files for your assignment in a zip file. Eachclass must have separate source and header files. If you do not do this assignment willNOT be graded.Grading:• programming style and documentation (10%)• read and create each maze level properly (5%)• the player and swans move through the maze correctly (10%)o the apples are picked up and used correctly (5%)o the keys are picked up and used correctly with the doors (5%)o the swans send the player back correctly (5%)• create the Game class and object (5%)• create the Actor class (5%)• create the Swan class and object (10%)• create the Player class and object (5%)• input validation for commands and reading the files (10%)• reflections document to include the design description, test plan, test results, andcomments about how you resolved problems while designing and implementing yourprogram (20%)You must include a makefile put all files for your assignment in a zip file. If you do notdo this assignment will NOT be graded.Each class must have separate source and header files. If you do not do this assignmentwill NOT be graded.If your program segfaults at anytime, you will lose 20 points.Design your ProgramAs always you should sit down with pencil and paper and sketch out the design. Developthe necessary algorithms. Do a desk test, i.e. walk through your algorithms and code tolook for logic errors.Nope! No keyboard yet! Now design your incremental development. Your programshould be decomposed into functional units. If not, go back to the previous paragraph.Look at the pieces and decide on the order you should use to implement and test eachpart. Reading the floor into your program and then moving an actor are probably goodplaces to start. Then add a level to test using the ladder. Once you have the developmentyou are ready!Nope! No keyboard yet. ? Design and organize the directories for your project. Youshould have a working directory. Maybe you need a subdirectory to hold the your floorplans. Have you designed your floor plans? What is there to design? Maybe you canhave a floor that allows you to test only one function or command at a time? Be carefulwith file names. The default first file always has the same name. If you overwrite onethen you’ll need to create it again. Always have one directory to save a copy of yourcode as you get each increment to compile. If you’re paranoid (I know I am) maybe youhave more than one stash and on different devices?Now, you’re ready to code!The moral is: Always plan ahead and make it as complete as you can!","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C++","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"}]},{"title":"Java代写： Assignment 1","slug":"page61","date":"2016-12-09T11:54:23.000Z","updated":"2017-01-11T07:37:23.378Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/09/page61/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/12/09/page61/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction完成一个java订票管理系统，包括买票，卖票，退票，学生票等等功能,内容细节比较多，需要要求的功能也比较多,RequirementITECH1000 / ITECH5000 Programming 1 1620CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 1 of 9Assignment 1OverviewThis is an individual assignment that requires you to design, develop and test a small procedural Javaprogram.Timelines and ExpectationsPercentage Value of Task: 20%Due: 16:00 Friday the 9th of September (week 7)Minimum time expectation: 10 hoursLearning Outcomes AssessedThe following course learning outcomes are assessed by completing this assessment: Identify and use the correct syntax of a common programming language Recall and use typical programming constructs to design and implement simple softwaresolutions Reproduce and adapt commonly used basic algorithms Utilise pseudocode and/or algorithms as a major program design technique Write and implement a solution algorithm using basic programming constructs Demonstrate debugging and testing skills whilst writing code Develop self-reliance and judgement in adapting algorithms to diverse contexts Design and write program solutions to identified problems using accepted design constructsITECH1000 / ITECH5000 Programming 1 1620CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 2 of 9Assessment DetailsThe Federation University Australia Olympic Games are about to commence! The games have beenscheduled to begin on Saturday 8th October 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time toprepare to sell spectator tickets.Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.Stage 1: DesignThis stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and howit is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template hasbeen provided for your use.Requirements:1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of thisprogram.2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this willoccur in Stage 3: Testing.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure thatonly valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed ofthis and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exceptionhandling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may includeextra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.Test Case Expected Result Actual ResultThe user selects to purchase adulttickets.The user is prompted toenter the number oftickets to purchase.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 3 of 9Stage 2: Program DevelopmentUsing the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticketsales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing therequirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups: Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essentialcomponents of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code towork and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to useconstants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for theserequirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will notreceive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used theappropriate programming construct to do so.At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, orto modularize it straight away. Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used toensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another asparameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is notessential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see. Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirementshave been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we havenot covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until thegames commence.All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, usingnaming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.Base Functionality:1. Display a welcome message when the program starts The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just longenough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this. The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIAOLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white spacefirst. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces? A second line of the message should be blank. The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”. The fourth line should be blank.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 4 of 92. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option untilthe user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If aninvalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make anotherselection.3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the usercan select General Admission Tickets, Student Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The userselects an option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user isadvised and shown the menu again to make another selection.a. Should the user select General Admission Tickets or Student Tickets, they are promptedto enter the Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required,they are returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchaseadditional tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, buta purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.b. Should the user select Finalise Order:i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchasedand the total cost of the tickets in this order. A General Admission ticket costs$13.50; a Student ticket costs $7.75.ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of adult ticketssold and the total number of child tickets sold. This is a combined total from allorders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in eachindividual order.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 5 of 9iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.c. Should the user select Cancel Order:i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and boththe total number of adult tickets and the total number of child tickets sold across ALL orders.Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After thefinal row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 6 of 9Standard Functionality:6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order isdisplayed until the order is finalized7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods asparameters.Advanced Functionality:8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until thegames begin.a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to importjava.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time theprogram runs, and Saturday 8th October 2016.c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 7 of 9Stage 3: TestingUsing a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed inStage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has notworked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your programproperly.To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in yourActual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Toolthat is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides threeseparate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirementsthrough to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.Base Functionality:This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when theprogram starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewingticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.Standard Functionality:In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that havebeen added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality mustalso be tested.If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data betweenmethods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.Advanced Functionality:This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the gamescomments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.SubmissionYour program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into theAssignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 8 of 9Marking Criteria/RubricTaskAvailableMarksStudentMarkStage 1: Design DocumentationDevelopment of an algorithm describing how the program should function All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Logical structure 1Documented test cases to validate program All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entriesare handled smoothly1Stage 2: Program DevelopmentA Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.1Base Functionality: Display of a welcome message when the program starts 1 Menu displayed until user chooses to exit 1 Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of generaladmission and student tickets2 View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total numberof general admission tickets and the total number of student tickets sold1 Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user 1Standard Functionality: Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menuuntil the order is finalised1 Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods 2Advanced Functionality: Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcomemessage3Stage 3: TestingDocumented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and theresults of this testing. Testing of base functionality1 Testing of standard functionality1 Testing of advanced functionality1Total 20CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 9 of 9FeedbackAssignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

The two major tasks are outlined below.Provided With:You are given a file called Assignment1.java that contains a main method. Use this class to runthe code you write. Your code must work with this file; you cannot alter this file as a means of makingyour code work. The marker will use a file similar to this to test the functionality of your code.You are also provided two files called ThingToWriteFile.java and ThingToReadFile.java. Theseclasses are provided to make fileIO easier. Have a look at the code to understand how to use theseobjects.Two text files are included. One contains the country information (data.txt) and the othercontains the country/continent information (continent.txt). NOTE: Both of these files have a headerline!On the last page of this assignment you are provided with an example output. Reference this fortext formatting.You may assume all data is correct and that there are no errors in the data files (don’t worryabout exceptions, or validating inputs, etc.).Stuff To Do:1. Implement a Country class:• The purpose of this object is to represent a country. This object will store someimportant information about the country and will have a small number of simplemethods.• This class will contain variables for the country name, population, area, and continent inwhich it exists.• You will need to write a constructor for the object. This constructor should take a name,population, area, and continent as parameters.• Write getter methods for the four instance variables (getName, etc.).• Write a method called getPopDensity to return the country’s population density(population/area).• Write a single setter method for the population instance variable (setPopulation).• Write a method called writeToFile which takes a ThingToWriteFile object as aparameter. This method must write some country details to the providedThingToWriteFile object provided. Below is an example of how to print the details tofile (commas are important):i. NAME, CONTINENT, POPULATION, POPULATION DENSITYii. Ex: Canada, North America, 34207000, 3.428881310807587• Write a method printCountryDetails that prints some country details to the user:i. NAME is located in CONTINENT has a population of POPULATION an areaof AREA and has a population density of GETPOPDENSITYii. Ex: Canada is located in North America has a population of 34207000, an areaof 9976140.0, and has a population density of 3.428881310807587• Write a toString method which simply returns a string in this format (include a new linecharacter at the end):i. NAME in CONTINENTii. Canada in North AmericaTest all your classes and methods before moving to the next section. Feel free to create otherhelper methods if necessary.2. Implement a CountryCatalogue class:• The class should have a few important instance variables:i. A final int called DEFAULT_SIZE which is equal to 5. This variable will beused when the catalogue array is instantiated.ii. A final int called NOT_FOUND which is equal to -1. This will be used as a flagfor some of our methods.iii. A country array called catalogue which will store a bunch of countries.iv. An int which stores the number of countries currently in the cataloguev. A set of called continents. This set will store the continents. Don’tknow how to create a set in java? Look up the java docs, or just Google “Javasets”. This set will make one of the below methods easier to implement.vi. A Map (dictionary) called cDict which will map a country nameto a continent. This will be used to make some of the below methods easier toimplement.• Write the constructor (this gets a little complex). The constructor should:i. Take two strings as parameters. One string will be the name of the filecontaining the country information, and the other will be the name of the filecontaining the continent information.ii. Instantiate the instance variables.iii. Read the country file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parsethe text, create a Country object based on the text, and then add the Country tothe catalogue with a method called addCatalogue (more on this below). Be sureto close the file when done.iv. Read the continent file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parsethe text, and then add the details to cDict and continents. Be sure to close the filewhen done.• Write a private method called addCatalogue which takes a country as a parameter. Thismethod only adds the provided country to the catalogue. However, we may have aproblem, the catalogue may be full! For this method, don’t worry about addingduplicate countries.• Write a private method called expandCapacity that will double the size of the cataloguearray. This method can be called by addCatalogue if there is no more room for a newcounty to be added.• Write a method called addCountry which takes a country as a parameter. This methodshould add the provided country object to the catalogue and update the continents setand cDict map. This method can call addCatalogue. For this method, don’t worry aboutadding duplicate countries.• Write a method getCountry that takes an index as a parameter and returns a Countryobject from the indexed location in the catalogue. This method should return null if theindex provided is inadmissible.• Write a method printCountryCatalogue which simply calls the toString method for eachCountry currently in the catalogue instance variable.• Write a method filterCountriesByContinent which will print out all the countries from aspecified continent (just use the county’s toString method). This method will take aString representing the continent we want the countries from.• Write a method searchCatalogue which takes a String of a name of a country we wantto find. This method will return an int representing the index of the found country incatalogue. If the item is not in the list, return NOT_FOUND. Print some sort ofnotification to the user if the country was not found.• Write a method removeCountry which takes a String of a name of a country we want toremove from the catalogue. This method can use searchCatalogue. Print somenotification to the user whether or not the item was successfully removed or not.• Write a method setPopulationOfACountry which takes a String representing the name ofa country we want to alter and an int representing the new population. This method cancall searchCatalogue. Print some notification to the user whether or not the item wassuccessfully altered or not.• Write a method saveCountryCatalogue which will write the catalogue’s county’s to file.This method takes a String representing the name of the file we want to save the detailsto. This method can simply call the Country’s writeToFile method.• Write a method findCountryWithLargestPop which will return the index location of thecountry with the largest population currently in the catalogue.• Write a method findCountryWithSmallestArea which will return the index location ofthe country with the smallest area currently in the catalogue.• Write a method printCountriesFilterDensity which prints out some country details if thecountry lies within some specified population density range. This method takes twointegers specifying the range inclusively (low and high). This method will have someadditional bookkeeping. See the example output provided below for a demonstration ofhow this output should look.• Write a method findMostPopulousContinent which prints out the continent, and the totalpopulation of that continent (based only on the countries in the catalogue) of thecontinent with the largest population. See the example output provided below for ademonstration of how this output should look.Test all your classes and methods. Feel free to create other helper methods if necessary.FAQ:• Q: How do I compare strings? Can I just use == ?o A: NO! DO NOT USE ==!!!!!!!!!!! Comparing Strings in Java is… very weird actually(and actually the subject of some debate). Use a method called equals instead. Forexample:? SomeString.equals(SomeOtherString) will be true if the Strings are the same.• Q: Why can’t I use == then?o A: It’s complicated. I’ll go into this later in the course.• Q: I don’t know how to do X?o A: Try going to www.google.ca and then typing X into the big text box.• Q: How do we use Maps (dictionaries) in Java?o A: The idea is similar to python, but there are some Java-isms here. First, check out thejava docs for Maps (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html).You’ll need to import the library they are defined in. Also, try looking up examples ofpeople using them. Instantiating them is a little weird (more details on this later in thecourse, for now you’ll have to just type the magic code) (HINT for instantiation:hashmap). Iterating through them is different too; try Googling how to iterate through amap in java.• Q: How do we use Sets in Java?o A: Basically exactly the same answer above, but the java docs are different(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html)• Q: How do I parse a String in Java?o A: Try looking up “splitting a string in java” with Google.• Q: I swear I did everything right, but for some reason my files won’t open!o A: This isn’t uncommon.? If you’re using eclipse, try putting the .txt files in the project directory (the samefolder containing the bin folder, src folder.? If you’re running from command line, try putting the files in the src folder.Non-functional Specifications:1.

Problem statement: formulate the problem.2. Analysis: determine the inputs, outputs, variables, etc3. Design: define the list of steps (the algorithm) needed to solve the problem.4. Implementation: the C code has to be submitted as a separate file. Just indicate here thename of the file.5. Testing: explain how you have tested and verified your C program.EXERCISE 1 (10 POINTS OUT OF 10)Connect 4 is a game of strategy for 2 players. Each player chooses a counter colour and thenthey take turns to place the counters into a rectangular grid of size M x N (typically 6 x 7).Counters are placed into the top of a column and fall down to occupy the next available slotin that column (see the photo in Figure 1). The game is won when either player is able tocreate a line of 4 counters vertically, horizontally or diagonally.Figure 1: Connect 4 GameThis assignment requires you to use a 2 dimensional matrix together with a modularprogramming strategy to recreate this game using C programming. Your game will allow youto play either against another person, or against the computer who will place counters atrandom.Program Requirements Offer the user a choice between playing the computer or another player. Display the current state of the board to each player You should use one or more 2 dimensional matrices to represent the Connect 4 playingboard declared inside function main() as a local variable and passed to other functions asneeded. As a minimum you should create your own functions to perform the following tasks:1. input counters;2. check the board for a win;3. display the board;Programming ConstraintsAll variables used must be local.IdeasTry to keep your program as flexible as possible e.g. use constants to define matrix sizes sothat these could be easily changed.Program in small sections, getting each part to work before integrating them all.Consider how to deal with invalid inputs to avoid crashing the program.Consider providing an option to change the matrix size and the winning length (e.g. connect 5)Don’t forget that this is an interactive game, it should be easy to use and look tidyNote: The programme requirements are becoming more vague (less well defined) with eachassignment to allow you the opportunity to interpret the problem in your own way anddevelop your own solution.What should be submitted?You should submit the followings:1) A short report (up to a few pages of text plus C source codes) detailing for each question:a) SDP steps 1 to 3 in the report (Report + Specification + Analysis + Algorithm Design)(40%)b) SDP step 4 (Implementation(35%) + Robustness(10%)): your C source code includingthe comments. (45%)c) SDP step 5 in the report (testing): you will explain your testing methodologyincluding: what you wanted to test, how you have tested it and the outcome of yourtests. (15%). Note: you do not need to include screenshots of resultsPlease refer to the file “EEE101 Marking Guidelines Assignments 4-5” on ICEfor a detailed marking scheme.2) The report in Microsoft Word or pdf format and C source code of your implementationfor each question should be zipped into a single file, i.e. the zip file will contain 4 files,two reports and two source codes.

String Utilities In this exercise you will implement several utility functionsinvolving strings. You will place all of your function prototypes in a header file namedstring_utils.h and all of your function definitions in a source file, string_utils.c. As before,you should implement your own main test driver program to test your functions, but youneed not hand it in.(a) void addChar(char str, char c, int n)- this function should add a char c at index n in string str. The following charactersshould be shifted up to make room for the inserted character. For example, a call tothis function on the string “Hello World”, ‘p’, ‘4’, would result in the string “HellpoWorld”(b) int numChar(const char src, char c)- this example determines the number of character c appears in the string. It doesnot matter if the letter in the string is capitalized or not. For example, a call to thisfunction on the string “HellO World”, ‘o’, would return 2(c) int isPalindrome(const char src)- this example determines if the string src is a palindrome or not. Return 1 if the stringis a palindrome and 0 if not. For example, a call to this function on the string “testset”,will return 1(d) int strCompare(const char str, const char str2)- Write your own string comparison function that compares two strings for equality.You cannot use the string comparison functions. Make sure the comparefunction is case insensitive. Return 0 if the two strings are equal and 1 if they are not.For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello world”, and “Hello World” willreturn 01(e) char strCat(char str, char str2)- Concatenate the two strings “str” and “str2” and store that in a newly created dynamicstring. The function should return this dynamic string. You cannot use the concatenation functions. For example, a call to this function on the string “Hello”, and“ World” will return a dynamically created string that contains “Hello World”(f) void consonantVowel(char str)- This function will print out the number of consonantes and vowels in the string. Note:printing should be done in the function (notice the return type is void). For example, acall to this function on the string “Hello”, will print Consonants: 3, Vowels 2Program 2. Array In this exercise you will write several functions that operate on arrays.You will place all the function prototypes in a header file named array_utils.h with theirdefinitions in a source file named array_utils.c. You should test your functions by writing adriver program, but you need not hand it in.(a) The dot product of two arrays are a = [a 1 ,a 2 ,a 3 ,..,a n ] and b = [b 1 ,b 2 ,b 3 ,..,b n ] isa · b =nXi=1a i b i = a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 + ··· + a n b nWrite a function that computes the dot product of the two arraysint dotProduct(const int a, int size, const int b, int size2);(b) Write a function that takes an integer array and returns the number of integers thatare prime in the arrayint numPrime(const int a, int size);(c) Write the following function:int arrayDifference(const int a, const int b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found ina , but not b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there shouldnot be any duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not wastememory.(d) Write the following function:int arrayIntersect(const int a, const int b, int sizeOfA, int sizeOfB);which dynamically creates an array and fills it with all integers that can be found in aand b . The values in the returned array should be unique; that is, there should not beany duplicates. Furthermore, the size of the allocated arrays should not waste memory.Program 3. Matrices In this exercise you will write several functions that operate onmatrices or two-dimensional arrays. For this exercise, we will restrict our attention to squarematrices-collections of numbers with the same number of columns and rows. You will place2all the function prototypes in a header file named matrix.h with their definitions in a sourcefile named matrix.c. You should test your functions by writing a driver program, but youneed not hand it in.(a) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if the sum of all of theelements in matrix A is equal to the sum of all the elements in matrix B. Return 0 ifthe summation is equal and 1 if they are not equal.int sumEqual(int A, int B, int n);(b) Write a function that takes two matrices and determines if they are equal (all of theirelements are the same).

There are two parts. In the first part, you will implement a program calc to addand subtract numbers specified in different bases (multiplication is extra credit). In the secondpart, you will implement a program format that will print the decimal values of bit sequencesrepresenting integer and floating point data types.2 Numeric Base Conversion and CalculatorImplement a program called calc with the following usage interface:calc The first argument, , is either the string “+”, for addition, or “-”, for subtraction. If youwant to implement multiplication, then can also be the string “*”. (If you do implementmultiplication, make sure to say so in your readme.pdf file so that the TAs know to check yourprogram for this functionality.)The next two arguments, and are integers of arbitrary size. Each of thesenumbers will be given in the form of:−?(b|o|d|x)d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0which can be interpreted as: a number can optionally start with a ’−’ sign, followed by a baseindicator, where b means the number is a binary number, o means octal, d means decimal, and xmeans hexadecimal. d n d n−1 …d 1 d 0 are the digits of the number.The final argument, , gives the base that the resulting number should be printedout in. Like the base indicator for the input numbers, this argument can be one of four strings: “b”for binary, “o” for octal, “d” for decimal, and “x” for hexadecimal. Your program should outputthe answer in the same form as the input numbers (that is, the output number should follow theregular expression given above).Some examples:$ ./calc + d1111111111111111 d1111111111111111 dd22222222222222221$ ./calc + b1101 b1 dd14$ ./calc + d999999999 d1 dd1000000000$ ./calc - d10 -d4 bb1110$ ./calc + -d10 -d4 b-b1110Note that the numbers in the first example are too large to fit in a 32-bit integer type in C; this iswhy the arbitrary size is emphasized above. Using a 64-bit integer type is not the solution since theinput integers can be arbitrarily large. Rather, you need to design data structures and algorithmsthat can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Assignment update: any decimal number that weask you to handle—either an input decimal number or output in decimal format—willfit in a 32-bit integer.Important: You must write the base conversion code yourself. You may not use type-casting,libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You mayuse the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the conversion (e.g., string handlingfunctions).Important: If calc detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message that startswith the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about the errorthat it detected.3 Format InterpretationImplement a program called format with the following usage interface:format The first argument, , is a sequence of 32 bits. Remember that your Cprogram will get it as a string of 1 and 0 characters in the argv[1] argument to main. Thissequence ofbits represents the binary values stored in 4 contiguous bytes in memory. The leftmostbits are stored in the byte with the smallest address while the rightmost bits are stored in the bytewith the largest address.The second argument, , gives the type that you should use to interpret the input bitsequence, and can be either int (integer) or float.The formats for the input bit sequence is as follows. If the type is:int: the format is two’s complement;float: the format is IEEE 754 single precision;Note that the input bit sequence can correspond to negative numbers.2Your program should print out the decimal representation of the input bit sequence, assuming abig endian byte ordering. Floating point numbers should be printed in scientific notation, where anumber 1.5x10 5 would be printed as 1.5e5. For positive infinity, output pinf, for negative infinity,output ninf, and for “NaN”, output NaN.Here are some examples:$ ./format 01000001010000100100001101000100 int1094861636$ ./format 10000001010000100100001101000100 int-2126363836$ ./format 01000001010000100100001110000100 int1094861700$ ./format 00000000000000000000000000000001 int1$ ./format 01000000110000110100001111010100 float6.10203e0$ ./format 00111010000111111111011000001000 float6.1e-4$ ./format 10000000000000000000000000000000 float-0.0e0$ ./format 01000000010010010000111111011011 float3.141593e0Important: You must write the interpretation code yourself. You may not use type-casting,libraries, or output formats in printf(). You may use standard C arithmetic operations. You mayuse the C standard libraries for functionality not related to the value interpretation (e.g., stringhandling functions).Important: If format detects an error in the inputs, it should print out an error message thatstarts with the string “ERROR”, followed by a string that gives an informative message about theerror that it detected. For this program, you can assume that any input bit sequence that is shorteror longer than 32 bits is erroneous.4 SubmissionYou have to e-submit the assignment using Sakai. Your submission should be a tar file namedpa2.tar that can be extracted using the command:tar xf pa2.tar3Your tar file must contain:• readme.pdf: this file should describe your design and implementation of the calc program.In particular, it should detail your design, any design/implementation challenges that youran into, and an analysis (e.g., big-O analysis) of the space and time performance of yourprogram.• makefile: there should be at least the following rules in your makefile:all build both your calc and format executables.calc build your calc executable.format build your format executable.clean remove all object files and executables. Prepare for rebulding from scratch.• source code: All source code and header files necessary for building your calc and formatexecutables. These should at least include calc.c and format.c.You can build your pa2.tgz file in the following steps:1. Put all the files you want to hand in in a subdirectory called pa2.2. In the parent directory that contains pa2, invoke tar:tar cvfz pa2.tgz pa2The arguments to tar are cfvz. The c tells tar to create a new archive file. The f tells tar that thenext command line argument is the name of the output file. The z tells tar to compress the tar filewith gzip. The v just makes tar list the files it’s putting into the archive.We will compile and test your program on the iLab machines so you should make sure that yourprogram compiles and runs correctly on these machines. You must compile all C code using thegcc compiler with the -Wall flags.5 Grading Guidelines5.1 FunctionalityThis is a large class so that necessarily the most significant part of your grade will be based onprogrammatic checking of your program. That is, we will build a binary using the Makefile andsource code that you submitted, and then test the binary for correct functionality against a set ofinputs. Thus:• You should make sure that we can build your program by just running make.• You should test your code as thoroughly as you can. In particular, your code should be adeptat handling exceptional cases.Be careful to follow all instructions. If something doesn’t seem right, ask.45.2 DesignHaving said the above about functionality, design is a critical part of any programming exercise.In particular, we expect you to write reasonably efficient code based on reasonably performingalgorithms and data structures. More importantly, you need to understand the performance (time&amp; space) implications of the algorithms and data structures you chose to use. Thus, the explanationof your design and analyses in the readme.pdf will comprise a non-trivial part of your grade. Givecareful thoughts to your writing of this file, rather than writing whatever comes to your mind in thelast few minutes before the assignment is due.5.3 Coding StyleFinally, it is important that you write “good” code. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to look atyour code as closely as we would like to give you good feedback. Nevertheless, a part of your gradewill depend on the quality of your code. Here are some guidelines for what we consider to be good:• Your code is modularized. That is, your code is split into pieces that make sense, where thepieces are neither too small nor too big.• Your code is well documented with comments. This does not mean that you should commentevery line of code. Common practice is to document each function (the parameters it takesas input, the results produced, any side-effects, and the function’s functionality) and addcomments in the code where it will help another programmer figure out what is going on.• You use variable names that have some meaning (rather than cryptic names like i).Further, you should observe the following protocols to make it easier for us to look at your code:• Define prototypes for all functions.• Place all prototype, typedef, and struct definitions in header (.h) files.• Error and warning messages should be printed to stderr using fprintf.5","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"C代写：Homework Assignment 2","slug":"page52","date":"2016-11-27T04:23:11.000Z","updated":"2017-01-11T09:24:53.232Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/27/page52/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/27/page52/","excerpt":"","text":"IntroductionC语言练习题，涉及一个用在控制台操作的航班订票和查询系统，主要涉及的知识有文件的读取和对二维数组的操作。用二维数组表示航班的座位信息，开始运行时从文件读取二维数组的大小和数据，然后显示菜单供用户操作，根据用户的输入执行航线和座位的选择。RequirementCS 1050 Homework Assignment 2JOE’S AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEMFall-2016Due : 14 th October, Friday 5:00 PM (No Extension). Submission system shuts off at 5pm.DirectionsComplete the following homework assignment using the description given in each section.IMPORTANT INFOtc.rnet will be down for maintenance during the course of the week of 10/3, it is anticipatedto be back up quickly but in order to be safe there is a temporary server created to work on hw2,which will be taken down as soon as the former is back up and running. So in order to not lose yourcode follow the instructions.Logging in to the new server:Putty: hostname =  test.rnet.missouri.eduTerminal on a mac: ssh pawprint@test.rnet.missouri.eduNotice the change of server, you will be logging into a different server (test.rnet.missouri.edu) andnot your original server (tc.rnet.missouri.edu).USE FTP clients like FileZilla or WinSCP to back up your files to your local machine. The test.rnetserver is a temporary one and will be take down during the week of 10/3 after tc.rnet is back,unfortunately we have no control over the timings, so whenever you code something make sure youkeep backing the file up immediately on your local machine. Like, every 15 minutes or once youfinish one function or whenever you quit out of test.rnet.Once you get an announcement on BLACKBOARD from DHEERAJ, saying “tc.rnet is back andrunning” move the local copy to tc.rnet server. Again, by using FTP.After that, Log into putty / terminal again usingtc.rnet.missouri.edu as the new host name and continue the way you have been doing it all thiswhile and submit it from here only.

Which will be developed by you. Thisapplication helps in reserving flight seats. This is done via implementing the 8 user-definedfunctions as explained below.Your program must print a menu for the user to select what he needs to do with the application.There will be admin mode which requires log-in via a passcode. There will be an option forreserving a seat on a flight. Third option is to exit the application.A file templateHW2.c is attached on Blackboard which will guide you on how to start theprogram and what are the global variables you need to use and how. You can follow that.Comments and prototypes have been given for you to help you out in the process.GLOBAL CONSTANTS and VARIABLES:#define ROW 6 //for row length#define COL 4 //for column length#define MAX 25 // for stringsFunctions to implement:1. void initialSeats(char flight[][COL], int count);The initialSeats function takes in a two-dimensional char array created in main. It will initializeall array elements to the character ‘O’. ‘O’ symbolizes the seat on the plane is open and can betaken. The int count variable is used to symbolize the number of people who already have a seaton the plane, this is a random number generated and sent from main. In this function it willrandomly create and assign an index in the two-dimensional array with the character ‘X’ for eachperson up to value of count. ‘X’ is used to symbolize that an element in the two dimensionalarray is occupied. This will be used later on in the program. MAKE SURE TO SEED RAND inMAIN. Below is the way to randomly generate the seats for each passenger to take. Thisfunction should be called as soon as your program starts.Keep in mind the possibility of the randomized index overwriting ‘X’, if it was already there.You have to handle that case. Beware!!int row = rand() % ROW;int col = rand() % COL;2. void displayMenu();Prints the display options. Admin mode, Reserve a seat and Exit. This is the main menu.3. void printFlightMap(char flight[][COL]);The printFlightMap function is printing off a two-dimensional character array. Thus, printing offthe characters stored in each index of the two-dimensional array either ‘O’ or ‘X’. As notedabove the ROW and COL are #defined in your program, use them. For loops are your friendshere. Called in admin mode and during reserving a seat (specifically in seatReservation).4. int loginMatch(int passcode, int adminPasscode);The loginMatch function is called to compare the passcodes, the function returns 1 if both matchand 0 if there is no match. This is called in admin mode. Should prompt for the passcode entryuntil the passcode matches. The adminPasscode is specified, everyone should use the sameadminPassocde, then compare that with the passcode user enters in main() when they wish tolog-in.5. int getTotalRevenue(char f1[][COL], char f2[][COL], char f3[ ][COL]);Note: f1, f2, f3 are flight1, flight2, flight3, just shorthanded.The getTotalRevenue function will take in all three two-dimensional character arrays created inmain and calculate the total revenue using the costMatrix two dimensional array. With each two-dimensional array f1, f2, and f3, search for the character ‘X’ stored in them, upon finding theindex of the character ‘X’, use the index to reference inside of the global two-dimensional arraycostMatrix (look above in Constants and Global Variables). While inside of costMatrix array,add the value stored in the two-dimensional array with a running total variable (Hint use +=).The function will return the total revenue earned thus far from seats reserved in all 3 flights. So,you will need nested for-loops. This is called only in admin mode.6. void flightMenu();Prints the three flight options as shown. Flights to Miami, Nashville and Las Vegas. This is donewhen reserve a seat option is chosen.7. void seatReservation(char flight[][COL]);The seatReservation function takes in a two-dimensional array and allows the user to reserve anindex on the two-dimensional array. Before any reserving is done, this function calls theprintFlightMap function mentioned earlier to allow the user to see the already populated two-dimensional array for that flight. Then, the user is asked to enter a row and column to reserve aseat. Additionally, this function will have built in error checking (look below at outputexample) Once the user has inputted a correct index within [0, ROW) and [0, COL) in the two-dimensional array, this function needs to check if that index entered is already taken in the two-dimensional array with the character ‘X.’ If the index is populated with ‘X’, an error will beshown to the user (look at the output below) and have them re-enter a new possible row andcolumn again. If the index entered is not filled with ‘X’, then assign that index with ‘X’, i.e.changing the element from ‘O’ to ‘X’. Before the function ends, it will call the functionprintFlightMap again and prints a success message.Remember, rows run from 0-5 and columns from 0-3. Error check for this too.8. void printMessage(char name[],char num[]);//DO THIS, IF YOU ARE DOING THE BONUSThis function is called for each flight option after the seatReservation() is called. It takes in twostrings, name of passenger and the flight number for that particular case. Both are characterarrays (strings). For flight Cou-&gt;Miami number must be set as “MIA1050”, for Cou-&gt;Nashvillenumber must be set as “BNA1050”, for flight Cou-&gt;Las Vegas num must be set as “LAS1050”,this must be done in main and the name and particular number must be sent to this function.Once in this function, you will merge (important part) the two strings into third string and printthat as the e-Ticket as shown below and print a confirmation message.Eg1: name is “Fred” number is “MIA1050”, your merged string should be FMrIeAd1050. Printthis as the booking confirmation number.Eg2: name is “Guilliams” number is “LAS1050”, you merged string should beGLuAiSl1l0i5a0ms.Eg3: name is “Christopher” number is “BNA1050”, your merged string should beCBhNrAi1s0t5o0pher9. int main(void)The main function will be doing all (most of) the function calls. In main, you need to create fourcharacter arrays of flight_1[ROW][COL], flight_2[ROW][COL], flight_3[ROW][COL], andstrings name[MAX],flight_number[MAX]adminPasscode= 105016; // everyone must keep this the sameAlso, before you call initialSeats function on all the flights arrays individually, make sure to findhow many people already reserved seats. This is done by creating a local variableseats = rand % 5 + 1 (this is your int counts in initialSeats function), rand()%5 +1 will give arandom number between 1-5; you only need to do this once. A menu system will be displayed forthe users to run specific parts of the program (See output below of what the menu system needsto look like). Make sure to implement error checking for invalid input!On the main menu, the user will see a display of options: The options are 1: Admin Portal, 2:Reserve a seat on a flight, and 3: Quit. The menu will need to loop until the exit option ischosen.To access the Admin Portal, the user enters a 1, and then must type a passcode that will bestored in a variable. Now, verify the passcode, call the loginMatch function (you shouldcompare) with passcode and adminPasscode to verify if it is an authentic log-in attempt. If thepair match, that is, they are equivalent then it means successful log-in. Upon successfulverification, inside of the admin portal, call printFlightMap on each flight array andgetTotalRevenue (See output below). Declare these variables in main().To access Reserve a seat, the user enters a 2. Inside of this portal, the user is displayed the threeflights that can be accessed to book a seat. (See below output). As always, verify the user inputfor flight option (1-5). 2 character arrays will be used, name and flight_number. Once a validflight option is chosen. Switch to that particular case and ask for the user’s first name and storeit in name[] and store the flight numbers (MIA1050,BNA1050,LAS1050) in flight_number[] asspecified above for that flight. Then, send the corresponding flight array to seatReservation,after successful reservation the user will be relocated back to the main menu. Then print asuccess message using name and fligh_number, just to confirm the booking.Must be done for each case (each flight).Then, if you are doing the bonus, call the printMessage with name[] and that particularflight_number[],. Note: flight1 is Miami, flight2 is Nashville, flight3 is Las Vegas.Please go through Sample Output and the document clearly before starting out.Sample OutputCharacter in bold are inputs from the user. Yours will vary but the outline must look similar. It is big,don’t worry, but will help give you a better idea.

Your job is to convince the TA thatyour program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺(90 pts) Program Implementation: Problem StatementYou are the proud owner of a virtual zoo that has places to house tigers, polarbears, and penguins! You will write a Zoo Tycoon game using classes andinheritance. Zoo Tycoon is a game where the user creates a zoo that has exhibits with anumber of different animals in each. Your zoo animals can be Tigers, Polar Bears, andPenguins. You start with an initial amount of money in your zoo bank, and from thereyou can begin to op.Specific Animal traits:• Ageo &gt;=3, adult 3• add number of babies born to that specific animal type to the exhibit• else, reprompt the user for an animal.• begin baby at age 0,4) nothing happens.After the random event, calculate your payoffs for the day based on normal visits forpenguins and polar bears, and possibly a bonus from a boom in attendance to see thetigers!Last, ask the player if they want to buy an adult animal, continue to the next day, or endthe game. If they chose to buy an animal, subtract that cost and add the animal to theappropriate exhibit.When you add money for profit or subtract money for sickness, the babies, oranimals with an age value less than 3 “days”, have a value of 2 times their normalpayoff or cost.Requirements• Each exhibit is a dynamic array of each type of animal.• You must have classes for a zoo, animal, tiger, penguin, and polar bear.• You Must Implement Inheritance: Your tiger, penguin, and polar bear mustinherit some traits and behaviors from the animal class, while there may beothers unique to the specific animal, such as a bonus for tigers.• Every time you buy an animal, at the beginning of the game or during play time,subtract that animals cost from the bank.• Subtract the feeding cost (which depends on how many animals you own andwhat kind) every morning.• Have a random event take place during each turn and perform those banktransactions correctly.• Animals that aren’t “born” in the zoo start at age 3 and this age is incrementedevery day. Animals younger than 3 (animals born in the exhibit) cost or earn thezoo 2 times their regular amount.• Make sure that the zookeeper doesn’t go bankrupt• Reprompt user at the end of each day (at the end of the game play for loop) tokeep playing until they lose or they wish to end the game.• No memory leaksExtra Credit (10 pts):TBD(10 pts) Program Style/CommentsIn your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments!

There should be no file extension after the file name“README”. Your README should include the following sections:Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do andhow you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you knowwho has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do notassume your reader is a computer science major.Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:Vim Questions:1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one levelwhere the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set thenumber of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent Nconsecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor iscurrently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift anentire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?Unix Question:4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named“output”?Java Question:5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positivenumbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?STYLE ( 20 points )Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup. You will be specifically graded oncommenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbersother than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for anobject.CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doingthe following:$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/ ~/pa7Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for thisprogram. Also, do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is aword, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. Theprogram will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has alreadybeen written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to thendetermine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursivemethods to implement this functionality.public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return thisreversed array of characters (#5 below).● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index inthe words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a chararray and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on theremaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in therecursive call. Otherwise, return false.● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome. If you open the file in vim, it should look like this:startearlystartoftenThe output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome notPalindromeInput array of strings:start, early, start, oftenThe file is not a palindrome.[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$Sample Output 2: Odd-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)Input file named oddPalindrome:StArTEaRlYsTaRtoFtEnufotofuNeTfOTrAtSyLrAetRaTsThe output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome oddPalindromeInput array of strings:StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, ufotofu, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTsThe file is a palindrome.[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$The sequence of characters in the array of Strings generated from the input file reads the same forwards andbackwards (non-case sensitive), so it is a palindrome. Note that because the length of the array is odd, themiddle string must also be a palindrome (in this case the middle string is “ufotofu”, which is a palindrome).Sample Output 3: Even-length palindrome (user input in BOLD)Input file named evenPalindrome:StArTEaRlYsTaRtoFtEnNeTfOTrAtSyLrAetRaTsThe output from running PA7indrome will give you the following:[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$ java PA7indrome evenPalindromeInput array of strings:StArT, EaRlY, sTaRt, oFtEn, NeTfO, TrAtS, yLrAe, tRaTsThe file is a palindrome.[cs11fxyz@ieng6-201]:pa7$Sample Output 4: Palindrome with new lines (user input in BOLD)Input file named newLinesPalindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets tospin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or haveclicked the “Finish Player 2” button.● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. Ifboth players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.Example scores and their outcomes:Player 1 70 120 20 100 100 95Player 2 90 110 120 100 105 100Winner Player 2 Tie Player 1 Tie Player 1 Player 2Implementation Details:This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUIlayout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.1. Setting up the GUI:Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.The top panel will have 3 labels:● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default ornot! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s scoreThe bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).● “Click to Spin P1”● “Finish Player 1”● “Restart”● “Click to Spin P2”● “Finish Player 2”The wheels on the center canvas:● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvasshould be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we willbe displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize anarray of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your imagesare directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in thecorrect order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in thecorrect order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to thesescore values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of scorevalues will be parallel arrays.private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. Thismeans that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,and so on.● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you willprobably want to pass to the constructor are:○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should behorizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to findthe x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of theright half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (makesure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvasThe red arrows on the center canvas:● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, andsize 16.● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,and size 16.See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.2. Wheel FunctionalityBecause the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore mustcontain a run() method).Creating a wheel:● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as aparameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The nextVisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount ofticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.Spinning the wheel:● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, thecontroller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will wanta method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number ofadditional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow thewheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cyclingthrough the array of images.○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until youreturn MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using asetter method.● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. Ifthe number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the nextindex in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reachthe last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is lessthan 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheeldelay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. Whenthe wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops oncethe number of ticks is zero.● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controllerknow that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, andscore. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ valueswhen something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.3. Controller FunctionalityYou will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed onthe buttons.● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”button and all buttons associated with Player 2.● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Oncethe wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at leastonce, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning byclicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score isover 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button isenabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated forPlayer 1.● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over messageshould be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2won (see screenshots for detail).Summary of the buttons● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:○ The wheels are spinning○ The player’s score has passed 100○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is alsodisabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:○ It changes the scores back to 0○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.Implementation Requirements for Button Event HandlingTo manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside theSpin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) methoddeclared and implemented.Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in oneactionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.4. Sample Screenshots:The start of the program. Bothplayer’s scores are set to 0,with the arrows pointing to 50.Only the buttons: “Click to SpinP1” and “Restart” are enabled.After Player 1 clicks “Click toSpin P1”, the score for Player1 is updated. The “FinishPlayer 1” button is nowenabled after 1 spin.Player 1 clicks “Finish Player1”, and now only “Restart” and“Click to Spin P2” buttons areenabled.Player 2 now clicks “Click toSpin P2”, the score for Player2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”button is now enabled after thefirst spin.After Player 2 clicks “FinishPlayer 2” The winner textappears. The only buttonenabled is “Restart”.This is the case when Player1’s score is over 100, thusPlayer 2 wins.In the case that Player 1’sscore exceeds 100, thebuttons “Click to Spin P1” and“Finish Player 1” areautomatically disabled,allowing P2 to begin.If both player’s scores exceed100, the game results in a tie.TurninTo turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:&gt; cse11turnin pa7You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like.

We will not take any late files youforgot to turn in. Verify will help you check which files you have successfully submitted.It is your responsibility to make sure you properly turned in your assignment.Files to be collected:Note: You must turn in all the files necessary for your program to run, including the .jar files and .png files.Note: Also, if any exceptions are thrown in the terminal, you will lose points.Source Files: Image Files: Misc:PA7indrome.javaSpin100Controller.javaSpin100Wheel.java .png (20 of them) objectdraw.jarAcme.jarREADMEEC_Spin100Controller.java (extra credit)EC_Spin100Wheel.java (extra credit)Extra Credit ( 5 points )Setup: Create copies of your regular source files and name them EC_Spin100Controller.java andEC_Spin100Wheel.java.Along with the functionality listed below, you will need to change the size of the window if you are adding theextra buttons. Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.Overall Wins: 1 PointKeep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap eitherwheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the verticalcenter of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,neither player’s win count should change.Change Spin Direction: 1 PointAdd some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. Thereshould be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereasspinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). Youcan see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it doesin the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.Switch Starting Players: 3 PointsThe “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled inthe middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the otherplayer. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game willrestart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.Sample Screenshots:If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"Java代写：I NDIVIDUAL P ROJECT 03 - T HE L IBRARY","slug":"page47","date":"2016-11-23T03:16:42.000Z","updated":"2017-01-10T02:03:47.286Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/23/page47/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/23/page47/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction基本思路:面向对象的基础作业,根据题目要求定义属性和成员方法注意点:实例化对象与对象调用方法的运用,一个自定义类作为另一个自定义类的属性的理解RequirementO BJECT -O RIENTED P ROGRAMMINGI NDIVIDUAL P ROJECT 03 - T HE L IBRARYProject 03 BackgroundWrite a console (text) program comprised of a main() class, CSC211Project03, a driverclass, Project03Driver, and your Textbook class.The driver class should have•a data field that is a constant array of type String called SUBJECT_LIST and is initializedto at least five different textbook subjects.•a data field, library, that is an array of Textbook objects.

The games have beenscheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s timeto prepare to sell spectator tickets.Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.Stage 1: DesignThis stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and howit is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template hasbeen provided for your use.Requirements:1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of thisprogram.2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this willoccur in Stage 3: Testing.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure thatonly valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed ofthis and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exceptionhandling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may includeextra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.Test Case Expected Result Actual ResultThe user selects to purchase Tier 1tickets.The user is prompted toenter the number oftickets to purchase.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 3 of 9Stage 2: Program DevelopmentUsing the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticketsales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing therequirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups: Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essentialcomponents of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code towork and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to useconstants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for theserequirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will notreceive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used theappropriate programming construct to do so.At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, orto modularize it straight away. Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used toensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another asparameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is notessential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see. Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirementshave been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we havenot covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until thegames commence.All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, usingnaming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.Base Functionality:1. Display a welcome message when the program starts The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just longenough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this. The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIAOLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white spacefirst. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces? A second line of the message should be blank. The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”. The fourth line should be blank.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 4 of 92. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option untilthe user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If aninvalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make anotherselection.3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the usercan select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects anoption by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised andshown the menu again to make another selection.a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter theNumber of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they arereturned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additionaltickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but apurchase of 0 tickets is permitted.b. Should the user select Finalise Order:i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchasedand the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2ticket costs $11.25.ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 ticketssold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from allorders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in eachindividual order.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 5 of 9iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.c. Should the user select Cancel Order:i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and boththe total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After thefinal row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 6 of 9Standard Functionality:6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order isdisplayed until the order is finalized7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods asparameters.Advanced Functionality:8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until thegames begin.a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to importjava.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time theprogram runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just updatethe date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number ofdays until the games commence.c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 7 of 9Stage 3: TestingUsing a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed inStage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has notworked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your programproperly.To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in yourActual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Toolthat is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides threeseparate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirementsthrough to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.Base Functionality:This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when theprogram starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewingticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.Standard Functionality:In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that havebeen added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality mustalso be tested.If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data betweenmethods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.Advanced Functionality:This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the gamescomments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.SubmissionYour program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into theAssignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 8 of 9Marking Criteria/RubricTaskAvailableMarksStudentMarkStage 1: Design DocumentationDevelopment of an algorithm describing how the program should function All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Logical structure 1Documented test cases to validate program All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entriesare handled smoothly1Stage 2: Program DevelopmentA Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.1Base Functionality: Display of a welcome message when the program starts 1 Menu displayed until user chooses to exit 1 Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1and Tier 2 tickets2 View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total numberof Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold1 Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user 1Standard Functionality: Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menuuntil the order is finalised1 Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods 2Advanced Functionality: Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcomemessage3Stage 3: TestingDocumented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and theresults of this testing. Testing of base functionality1 Testing of standard functionality1 Testing of advanced functionality1Total 20CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 9 of 9FeedbackAssignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

A full file header for your README is not needed, but you still need toput your name and cs11f login at the top. However, all other style guidelines apply to all the files ( e.g. over 80characters apply to READMEs as well. )You will be specifically graded on commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names,sufficient use of blank lines, not using more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers other than zero and +/-1, and use of accessor/mutator methods to access private fields (getters andsetters) where specified.CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )You are asked to create an interactive 3 x 3 puzzle game for pre-schoolers. The player has to drag the puzzle pieces onthe right to the correct location on the left to form a complete image. This assignment does NOT involve ActiveObjectsor require a paint() method. The correctness of this assignment is based on meeting the required functionalities listedbelow.Part 0: Overview BoardPieces PuzzlePiecesWe have a 3 x 3 puzzle, which gives us 9 puzzle pieces that are movable on the right. They can be draggedanywhere on the canvas, but not off the canvas. On the left, we have a 3 x 3 board. After a puzzle piece is draggedonto its correct location, the puzzle piece is “locked” into the board and is no longer movable.The reason “locked” is in quotes is because the puzzle piece is actually not locked. We created this illusion byhaving two different types of Pieces here: PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece. When a PuzzlePiece (movable piece on theright) is dragged onto a BoardPiece (fixed piece on the left), your program will do some verification to see if theymatch. If so, it’s going to hide the PuzzlePiece and reveal the BoardPiece with the same image as the PuzzlePiece.So it may seem like the PuzzlePiece is locked in place, but it’s actually a different BoardPiece that’s displayed onthe canvas. Now that we know the basic idea/hack behind this game, how do we implement it?Part 1: Useful InterfacesTake advantage of interfaces! We have two different kinds of Piece types here, but they share a lot in common.We’ll implement the Piece interface later in PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece classes.1. The Highlightable interface is used to draw borders and highlights around each piece:import java.awt.Color;public interface Highlightable {public abstract void showHighlight( Color color );public abstract void hideHighlight();}2. The Hideable interface is used to hide and show pieces:public interface Hideable {public abstract void show();public abstract void hide();}3. The Piece interface, which extends the two interfaces above and includes a few other methods:import objectdraw.;public interface Piece extends Highlightable, Hideable {public abstract boolean contains(Location point);public abstract boolean equals(Object o);public abstract Location getCenter();public abstract int getId();public abstract void move(double dx, double dy);}Part 2: Piece ClassesYou will create 2 Piece classes: class BoardPiece and class PuzzlePiece.Each of these classes will implement the Piece interface. For example:public class BoardPiece implements Piece { … }Each Piece class will hold the specifics about that piece:• the piece image (a VisibleImage created from passing an Image object to its constructor)• ID (integer indexed from 0 to 8 in order of left to right and top to bottom, each ID represents a piece witha distinct image)• center (a Location object that represents the center point of this piece)• borders/highlights (PuzzlePiece (the movable pieces on the right) has one black FramedRect object righton top of the edge of the image and wraps around it as the border. BoardPiece (the fixed pieces on theleft) has two FramedRect objects, one right on top of the edge of the image, and one that’s inset by 1px,so it creates a thicker outline. When the game first starts, BoardPiece should only display the outerhighlight as black.)Thus, the constructor for BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece should be identical. For example:public BoardPiece(Image img, int id, Location loc, DrawingCanvas canvas) { … }Each Piece class will also implement the methods from the Piece interface.• showHighlight() and hideHighlight() can access and change the visibility of the FramedRect objects thathighlight each piece.• show() in PuzzlePiece should show the image and the black FramedRect highlight. show() in BoardPieceshould just show the image. We will call showHighlight() when we want to display the green highlight toindicate the puzzle piece is in the correct spot on the board (more on this later).• hide() in PuzzlePiece should hide the image and the highlight. hide() in BoardPiece does nothing unlessyou plan to implement the extra credit.• contains() in PuzzlePiece determines whether some point is contained in the VisibleImage associated withthat piece (Hint: use VisibleImage’s contains() method). contains() method in BoardPiece requires a littlemore logic. If you are giving this puzzle to someone, you don’t want him/her to solve this so quickly by justdragging the PuzzlePieces close enough to the BoardPieces so they get locked in automatically. If you arethe player, you also don’t want to be forced to drag the PuzzlePiece so your cursor/PuzzlePiece fallsperfectly within the BoardPiece. So what we are going to do here is add a different check: instead ofpassing the point where the cursor is, we are going to pass the center of the PuzzlePiece we are draggingto contains(). If the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of theBoardPiece, then we can say “the point is contained” in the BoardPiece. What we are really checking hereis whether the center of the PuzzlePiece is contained in the 50 x 50px square in the BoardPiece.• equals() checks if two Pieces are equal (for example, does the PuzzlePiece match with the BoardPiece inthe board grid?). This is done by checking the unique ID (0 - 8) we assigned to each piece.• getId() returns the unique ID of the Piece.• getCenter() returns the center of the Piece.• move() in BoardPiece should do nothing since BoardPieces are fixed. You would have to add someimplementation if you decide to do extra credit. move() in PuzzlePiece is in charge of moving thePuzzlePiece around. There’s one tricky thing about this method… you need to make sure that thePuzzlePieces cannot be dragged off the canvas. More specifically, the center of PuzzlePiece should not beable to move off the canvas.Part 3: class PuzzleNow we’ve set up the building blocks for this game, we can start implementing the controller Puzzle class. ClassPuzzle should extend WindowController and include main() that starts a new instance of Acme.MainFrame. Thecanvas size should be 735 by 380 pixels.Part 3a: Get ImagesNine 100px x 100px puzzle piece images are available for you in ~/../public/PA5-images/. They are numberedfrom p0 to p8 (e.g. p0.jpg, p1.jpg, …).In order to load these images into the program, use the getImage() method in class Puzzle (the main GUI controllerthat implements WindowController). For example:getImage(“p0.jpg”);We need to load 9 images into an Image array (array of Image objects). Instead of hardcoding 9 lines ofgetImage(), we can do this in a loop using some string concatenation. getImage() will return an Image object. Youshould pass each Image object as an actual argument to each the of Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, and insidethat Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, make a VisibleImage object based on the Image object.Part 3b: LayoutThe main Puzzle class will also layout the BoardPieces and the PuzzlePieces as seen in the earlier screenshots.Again, instead of hardcoding 18 different locations, we are going to use two arrays to store Locations, one forBoardPieces and one for PuzzlePieces. The good news is that the constants and the formulas of calculating theseLocations have been worked out for you:private static final int PIECES_PER_COL = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzleprivate static final int PIECES_PER_ROW = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzleprivate static final int PUZZLE_SPACING = 20; // num of px between PuzzlePiecesprivate static final int PUZZLE_OFFSET = 355; // offset from left side of canvasprivate static final int BOARD_MARGIN_X = 25; // left margin of the boardprivate static final int BOARD_MARGIN_Y = 40; // top margin of the boardprivate static final int SIDE_LENGTH = 100; // side length of each PieceBoardPiece with index i is located atx = BOARD_MARGIN_X + SIDE_LENGTH (i % PIECES_PER_COL)andy = BOARD_MARGIN_Y + SIDE_LENGTH (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).PuzzlePiece with index i is located atx = PUZZLE_OFFSET + PUZZLE_SPACING (i % PIECES_PER_COL + 1)+ SIDE_LENGTH (i % PIECES_PER_COL)andy = PUZZLE_SPACING (i / PIECES_PER_ROW + 1) + SIDE_LENGTH * (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).These x and y coordinates represent the upper left corners of the VisibleImage in each Piece. You can check themath if you are curious what’s up with all these mods and divides.Before you place all the Pieces onto the canvas, add a Text object as the winning message “YOU WON!” at x = 355and y = the Y value of the fourth BoardPiece. It should have font size of 55 in bold and green. Hide the winningmessage for now, and we will come back to it later (the order of creation matters here because it affects thedrawing arrangement).Now let’s put the Pieces onto the canvas. Placing the BoardPieces is easy. We already have the Image array andthe Location array for BoardPieces. We just need another array of the interface type Piece to keep track of theBoardPieces. We will go through the Image array and the Location array and create BoardPieces in order. EachBoardPiece ID should match with its index in the Piece array.For PuzzlePieces though, we want to pick one of the nine images randomly. We can do so by implementing amethod called getRandomPuzzlePiece() that takes in Location and DrawingCanvas. This method will use aRandomIntGenerator that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 8. We will first check if this randomlygenerated index represents an image that’s already used. If so, we want to get another random index until we findan unused one, because every PuzzlePiece should have a unique image. Once we’ve found an unused index, wecan create a new PuzzlePiece. We are going to return this Piece we randomly created and store a reference to it ina Piece array. We’ll do this 9 times to place all the PuzzlePieces. Note that the ID in PuzzlePiece is NOT associatedwith its random array index but with the unique piece image.To avoid using magic numbers like 8, you can create a MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES constant. In our case,MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES is 9. When we need to use this as an index, we can do MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES – 1, whichtakes care of the offset from zero-based indexing.Hooray! Now you should be able to see all the BoardPieces and PuzzlePieces on your canvas. But we are not quitethere yet. Your GUI controller (class Puzzle) needs to handle all the mouse events and the logic of verifying thePieces. Take a break before you proceed. :)Part 3c: Dragging PuzzlePieceBy PA5, you should be pretty familiar with onMousePress(), onMouseDrag(), and onMouseRelease(). The logic isstill the same. You want to keep a reference to lastPoint and find the difference between lastPoint and currentpoint. You do need to do one additional thing here, and that is keep track of which PuzzlePiece is being grabbed.You can do so by looping through the Piece array holding all the PuzzlePieces and find which PuzzlePiece containsthe point.Part 3d: Verifying PuzzlePieceHmmm… Where should you be checking if the puzzle piece has been placed (not while still dragging) in the correctspot on the board to the left? There’s only one place, and I’ll let you answer it (HINT: it is NOT in onMouseDrag()).But I’ll walk you through how to verify a puzzle piece has been placed correctly. Remember many words ago, wesaid if the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the BoardPiece, we can saythe PuzzlePiece is “contained” in the BoardPiece (this check is already done in contains()). Here, the methodsyou’ve implemented in BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece come in handy. You can use getCenter() to get the center ofthe grabbed puzzle piece and call contains() on every BoardPiece in a loop. If we were able to find a BoardPiecethat contains the center of the grabbed puzzle piece AND they are equal (matching IDs), then we can go ahead and“lock” this Piece. Again, the “locking”is done by hiding the grabbed puzzlepiece and showing the BoardPiece asdescribed in the overview. Don’tforget to show green highlightsaround the BoardPiece to let the pre-schoolers know that they’ve placedthe Piece correctly!Part 3e: Verifying VictoryAlmost there… I can hear the sound of victory! How can we check if the puzzle is finished? One easy way to do thisis having yet another array. This array will contain booleans that represent whether a Piece has been “locked”.Since the Pieces have unique IDs from 0 to 8, we can just use those as indices and mark them true as they get“locked”. The game is done after every element in this boolean array becomes true. At the moment of victory, youshould hide the green highlights around each BoardPiece and display a seamless image composed of 9 pieces. Youshould also show the winning message.And yaaaaaay, that’s the end of this assignment.RunningTo compile your Puzzle game, type this into the terminal:&gt; javac -cp ./Acme.jar:./objectdraw.jar:.

Dragging after Winning [2.5pts total]After the user has finished the game, the 9 BoardPieces should look like a complete image of an aerial view of UCSan Diego. As a part of extra credit, enable dragging this “image” around the canvas (really, you are dragging these9 pieces together). You will have to change the move() method inside BoardPiece. Don’t worry about dragging theimage off canvas (you can always resize the canvas and get it back).2. Clicking after Winning [2.5pts total]The pre-schoolers just can’t stop playing your puzzle again and again, but their teacher is not always there torestart the game for them.

To help resolve any issues or errors youmay have had in implementing the class, a model solution has been posted on the course website in the Project02 Starter Package.The Interface DrawableInterfaceIn Lab 06 you designed the Java interface DrawableInterface and implemented it in theBall and Block classes. In this project, you will re-use that interface. The requirements for theinterface DrawableInterface can be found in the UML diagram above. This interface and itsmethods should be fully documented using javadoc style comments.The DrawableStudent ClassThe DrawableStudent class represents the visualization of a university student. It shouldhave all the characteristics and behaviors of a Student, but also implement theDrawableInterface. You should implement all methods described in the interface,similar to the steps you took in Lab 06, except, instead of using a data field for the x-position and a data field for the y-position, use a single Point object.Because we need to draw our textbook, the Textbook data field of our parent will not beenough. We need to create our own DrawableTextbook data field, myBook. Yet, we stillwant to take advantage of the parent class implementation, so at the end of the constructor,call setBook(myBook) to replace the default parent class Textbook with yourDrawableTextbook.The DrawableStudent class needs a tossBook method that sets the velocity of theDrawableTextbook. You only need to set the x-velocity so the textbook moves to the right.If all the classes are implemented properly, the textbook will sense when it gets to the rightside of the window and revers direction back to the student.The DrawableTextbook ClassThe DrawableTextbook class represents the visualization of a university-level textbook. Itshould have all the characteristics and behaviors of a Textbook, but also implement theDrawableInterface. You should implement all methods described in the interface, similar tothe steps you took in Lab 06, except, instead of using a data field for the x-position and a datafield for the y-position, use a single Point object.You can use the following Java code to implement the DrawableTextbook class draw method:public void draw(Graphics pen){checkBounds(pen);pen.setColor(bookColor);pen.fillRect(xPosition, yPosition, 50, 70);pen.setColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);pen.setFont(new Font(“Monospaced”, Font.BOLD, 20));pen.drawString(getBookInitials(), xPosition, yPosition+50);}This method calls two private DrawableTextbook methods, getBookInitials andcheckBounds that you must implement.The checkBounds method should perform similar to the checkPosition method in the twoprevious labs. If the book has moved to the edge of the window, the velocity in that directionshould be reversed and the book moved back into the window if it moved off.Since this method is a DrawableTextbook method, we don’t have access to the Paneldimensions. You can use the following code to get the clipping rectangle for the Panel by askingthe Graphics object pen:Rectangle edgeRect = pen.getClipBounds();The method getBookInitials creates and returns a string made up of the first letter of eachword in the textbook subject. Here are pseudo-code statements that perform the task:String bookSubject = some string to parseString initials = bookSubject.substring(0,1);for (int i = 0; i","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"Java代写：Assignment 3","slug":"page43","date":"2016-11-18T15:21:53.000Z","updated":"2017-01-04T13:28:08.650Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/18/page43/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/18/page43/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction基本思路:判断逻辑表达式的真假,根据优先级从里往外一层一层的解表达式,最后的到表达式的值注意点:题目中符号的值是给定的,不用自己定义,在或与非结合的时候表达式的值的计算要注意RequirementAssignment 3Instructor: Musard BalliuOctober, 2016In this assignment, you will implement an object-oriented application to deter-mine the truth value of boolean circuits. A boolean circuit is a logical formulaconsisting of boolean variables a,b,x,y,···, negation (NOT, written as !), con-junction (AND, written as ∧) and disjunction (OR, written as ∨). For example,(a ∧ b) ∨ (c ∨ !(b)) is a boolean circuit on variables a,b and c. The truth valueof a boolean circuit is either true or false, and it can be determined when-ever the truth values of all variables of the circuit are fixed. For example, ifa = true,b = false and c = true, the truth value of the boolean circuit aboveis true. An assignment of truth values to the boolean variables of a circuit iscalled a truth assignment for that circuit.Two circuits are equivalent iff they have the same truth value for all possibletruth assignments of their variables. For example, the circuit a ∧ a is equivalentto the circuit a, and the circuit !(a∨b) is equivalent to the circuit !(a)∧!(b). Thecircuit a∧b is not equivalent to the circuit a∨b, since, for instance, if a = falseand b = true, the truth value of the first circuit is false, and the truth value ofthe second circuit is true.The free variables of a circuit are the variables used in that circuit (withoutrepetitions). For example, the free variables of the circuit (x ∧ y) ∨ !(x) are xand y.The taskIn this assignment, you are given two classes, Assignment.java and Circuit.java,and they are already implemented for you. In particular, the method equals(),implemented in Circuit.java, allows to determine whether or not two circuits areequivalent.1DIT948-2016, Assignment 3The goal of this assignment is to complete the implementation of subclassesVariable.java, Not.java, And.java e Or.java of the superclass Circuit.java. Con-cretely, you have to complete the implementation of the methods isTrueIn(),freeVariables() and toString() for each subclass (and a few other methods,constructors and instance variables). The methods have the following specifica-tion:• isTrueIn(Assignment a) determines whether a circuit is true for a givenassignment a.• freeVariables() returns an array containing the free variables of a cir-cuit, in any order and without repetitions.• toString() returns a string representation of the circuit.You also have to implement a main class, CircuitMain.java, that creates twocircuits !(a ∧ b) and !(a) ∨ !(b) and checks whether or not they are equivalent.Finally, you have to create n random circuits of maximal depth 5, calculate theirtruth value, and print to the console both the (string representation of) circuitsand their truth values, for a given positive integer n provided as input by theuser.In order to get a VG, you must implement a graphical user interface (GUI) thathandles the features in class CircuitMain.java.The specification of each method is provided as commented java files, includedin the following sections and available for download fromhttp://www.cse.chalmers.se/ musard/teaching/programming2016/dit948-2016/Assign3 2016.zipThe interface, example sessionThe set of all variables used in a random circuit is ”v”,”w”,”x”,”y”,”z”,”a”,”b”,of which the variables ”v”,”y”,”a” are true in the assignment (and, conse-quently, the remaining variables are false). The class CircuitMain has a mainmethod which, when executed, should lead to an user session of the followingkind:Welcome to the DIT948 circuit oracleI will now check equivalence for the following circuits:Circuit 1: !((a /\\ b))Circuit 2: (!(a) \\/ !(c))2DIT948-2016, Assignment 3The result is: falseHow many random circuits should I generate? 5I have created the following random circuits:1.

While the ultimate test ofa program is that it does what it is supposed to do, we should be able toread the program and understand it.The assignment is to be completed in groups of two students. (Groups of differentsize should first be agreed with the course instructor.)Solutions must be uploaded to the GUL system by 23:55 on October 19.Please note: The submission must be made via GUL. It’s no good sendingit to me via email, either before or after the deadline!Only Java source files should be uploaded, no class files. Your Java files shouldbe put in a zip-archive with the following name:assign3_author1_author2.zipwhere author1, author2 are the surnames (family names) of the group members.You must also supply a README-file (README.txt) containing the names ofthe authors and their social security numbers, together with a brief statementabout each author’s contribution. For example, “author1 has been responsible foruser input and author2 for the program logic”. A statement such as “All authorshave contributed equally to all aspects of the program” is not acceptable.Note that each author must submit individually via the GUL (even thoughit is the same program!). Only students who submit via the GUL can be graded.All comments etc. will be posted on the course web page.9DIT948-2016, Assignment 3Once the deadline has passed, each group must explain solutions to the TAsduring the first Thursday supervision session. Exceptions are to be agreedwith the instructor and the TAs.

How can you do your assignment when half of it is gibberish!? You didn’t ask for a taskdescryption! As you are thinking this, something suddenly occurs to you. You are a Java programmer now!You have all the skills you need to crack this silly cipher, and you’re going to do it!Before You BeginRemember that this task is here to help you improve your programming skills. When doing this task, youmight find some parts tricky, but this is normal and also a good thing (if we were never challenged, we wouldnever learn anything!). The most important things are to start this task as soon as you can, to ask questionswhen you need help and to be persistent! It’s often good to work on one part of the assignment at a time, thensubmit to PASTA to see how you went with it. Try to be creative when approaching problems - usually thereare many ways to do something. We hope you enjoy this cryptography-themed task! :)Part 1 – Your Own Secret MessagesIn the first part of this assignment, your task is to write a program to encrypt and decrypt your very own secretmessages using a substitution cipher! This substitution cipher will involve swapping each letter of the alphabetwith a different letter and sometimes also removing spaces. For example, maybe “a” might be replaced with“e”, “b” might be replaced with “a”, “c” might be replaced with “f” and so on.In order to encrypt and decrypt these kinds of messages, the sender and receiver must both know a secret key.A key is a set of rules that tell you which letters to swap with which. One way that you can represent this keyis with a string that contains all of the letters from a to z exactly once. The first letter in the string should bethe letter that replaces “a” when encrypting, the second letter in the string should be the letter that replaces“b”, the third letter should be the one that replaces “c” etc.For example, if the string is “bzcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya”, then “a” would be replaced with “b”, “b” wouldbe replaced with “z”, “z” would be replaced with “a” and everything else would stay the same. So, a word like“zebra” would become “aezrb”.When decrypting, the reverse would be done: “b” would be replaced with “a”, “z” would be replaced with“b”, “a” would be replaced with “z” and everything else would stay the same. So, “aezrb” would become“zebra”.All right, with that in mind, are you ready to make your own secret messages?INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20163Step 1 ‐ Getting the skeleton codeIn this task description, there is a section called Setting Up. Please read this section carefully for informationabout the skeleton code and follow the instructions to set up your workspace.Step 2 – Understanding the Encrypter classFor this part of the assignment (i.e. Part 1), we will be focusing on only two of the three skeleton code classes:Encrypter and SecretMessages. You could think of the Encrypter class as a set of instructions formaking encrypters. That is, things that can encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Each encrypter has its ownspecial key for encrypting and decrypting messages, and also a setting for removing whitespace. (Recall thatin programming, all characters that are not visible when displayed are called collectively whitespace. Thus,the whitespace includes the normal space “ ” but also the tab “\\t”, new line “\\n” and some other characters.)This option to remove whitespace is useful, because messages withoutspaces are harder to guess. For example, it might be easy to guess thatsomething like “T od Dto” by looking at word length, but “TodDto”would be harder!Sometimes you might not want to remove whitespace, though,because then it’s more difficult to read the message after decryptingit. For example, “IamMia” is more difficult to read than “I am Mia”.Perhaps when testing your code, it would be nicer if the decryptionwas very easy to read. So, in some cases, not removing whitespacecould be helpful.This is why each encrypter has a removeSpaces setting. If removeSpaces is set to true, then the encrypterwill remove all whitespace when encrypting. If it is set to false, then the encrypter will not remove whitespace.Note that the encrypter should never remove whitespace when decrypting, as this just makes the messageunnecessarily difficult to read.Step 3 – Writing the Encrypter ClassYou are welcome to complete this task in any order you like, but if you’re not sure where to begin, try startingwith the getKey and isRemovingSpaces methods in the Encrypter class.The blue comments above each method tell you exactly what the method should do, and give you informationabout input and output. Please read this carefully!After you have written a method, it’s a good idea to check that it works correctly. You can do this by submittingyour code to PASTA. Even if you have only written one method, you can still submit your code. Rememberthat you are allowed as many attempts as you like, so there really is no harm in doing this. To submit yourcode, first make sure your code compiles (i.e. no red errors in Eclipse), then follow the submission instructionsat the end of this task description.If anything seems unfamiliar, try looking at the lecture slides, tutorial questions and textbook sections onobject oriented design. Also, here are a few hints that you might find useful when completing these methods!INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20164Hint 1 If you have a character and want to check if it is a letter or whitespace, you can use the Charactermethods isWhitespace and isLetter.Here’s an example of how you could check if the character ‘T’ is a letter:if (Character.isLetter(‘T’))System.out.println(“This is a letter”);Hint 2 You can easily check if a letter character is lowercase or uppercase using the following Charactermethods: isUpperCase, isLowerCase.Here is an example of how you could check if the character ‘B’ is uppercase:if (Character.isUpperCase(‘B’))System.out.println(“This character is an uppercase letter!”);Hint 3 Want to get the lowercase equivalent of an uppercase letter, or the uppercase equivalent of alowercase letter? Well then, these Character methods are just what you need: toUpperCase,toLowerCaseHere’s an example of how you could get ‘B’ in lowercase:char lowercaseB = Character.toLowerCase(‘B’); //lowercaseB will be ‘b’Hint 4 Say you have a character which is a lowercase letter, and you want to know its position in thealphabet. For example, ‘a’ is in position 0, ‘b’ is in position 1, ‘c’ is in position 2 etc.Here’s a simple way you can do it (note that charName is the name of the character you’re interestedin).int position = charName - ‘a’;How does this work? Well, charName and ‘a’ are converted to certain integers. ‘a’ is converted to97, ‘b’ is converted to 98, ‘c’ to 99 etc. (see this table for referencehttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html ). Then, these integers aresubtracted.So, something like ‘c’ – ‘a’ becomes 99 – 97, which is 2. Ah! And 2 is the position of ‘c’ in thealphabet. :D.To find the position of an uppercase letter, just convert it to lowercase first and follow the sameprocess!Hint 5 What about going backwards? What if you know the position of a letter in the alphabet and youwant to know what character it is? Well, we can do something similar to before!Here’s how we could find the character in position 4 of the alphabet:int character = (char) (4 + ‘a’); //character will be eWhy is this e? Well, ‘a’ is converted to 97, so we have 4+97, which is 101. Then, we convert 101to a character and get ‘e’.INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20165Step 4 – SecretMessages ClassNow that we’ve made our Encrypter class, it’s time to use it!Write a program in the class SecretMessages that creates an encrypter and allows the user to do variousthings with this encrypter.This encrypter should initially: use the key “zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy” to encrypt and decrypt messages be set to not remove spacesThe program should give the user 5 different choices of things to do with the encrypter:1. encrypt a message2. decrypt a message3. check the key4. change the key5. change the space-removal mode.After the user has made a choice, the program should use the encrypter to perform their choice. Then, it shouldallow them to make another choice and it should perform that action. It should keep allowing the user to makechoices until they decide to quit. See the next section for some examples.Example Input/OutputThe following are some examples of input/output.

Goodbye.INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20167Part 2 – Descryption DecryptionIn the last section, you made your own encrypter to encrypt and decrypt your own secret messages. Thisworked by swapping letters around. You also saw that you could remove spaces to make those messages moredifficult to decrypt. Of course, if you wanted to go a step further, you could also remove capitalisation andpunctuation. This would leave just a big block of letters.If someone handed you a long block of letters like that and you had to decrypt the message without the key,what would you do? It might seem like a difficult task, but we can use a special trick!Say you read a text in plain English, and found that the most common letter was “e”. Then, you read anencrypted message and found that the most common letter was “z”. Would you be able to guess what that “z”actually was? Probably! If the most common letter in English was ‘e’, then there would be good evidence tothink that that “z” was actually an “e”!You could do something similar with the rest of the letters! You could get a list of all the letters in Englishranked based on how frequently they occur and a list of all letters in the encrypted message ranked in the sameway. Then you could try to match up the letters in the lists to guess the key!Of course, this might not always work out exactly. For example, it might be tricky trying to decrypt a novelwith no e’s in it! (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel) ). However, it can be useful in giving you ageneral idea of which letter could be which, and you could try out different combinations! Generally, thelonger the encrypted message, the better this method will work.With all of this in mind, it’s time to finally discover what the encrypted part of the task description says!The encrypted message is quite short, which means that the distribution of letters not exactly the same asgeneral English. So, to make things a little simpler, we are providing a reference text to use. If you count thenumber of times each letter appears in the reference text, and sort the letters based on how often they appear,the list will be the same as the encrypted text.A reference text of standard EnglishThis is some sample text to use as a reference. Have you heard of quokkas? They’re reallycute Australian animals that seem like little roos with big puffy cheeks! If you want tosee one, the best way is to fly to Perth, then catch a ferry over to Rottness island.There are apparently about 10,000 on Rottness island. Wow! Sometimes, if you have superbselfie skills, you can take a selfie with them! They often look like they’re smiling,which makes them very photogenic! Tortoises are also very q-ute. They have shells, yousee. Tortoises might eat juicy fish. Did you hear fish is ‘poisson’ in French? Tortoisesare better than fish. Juice is tastier than wine. Is juice a good prize?Nnnnnooooooooooooo! This sentence is still strange. quip, quid, quiz, quote, quit. Gooddogs/ pups meet bugs under beds. Ponds. Pepper. Mind mood.*Actually spelt “Rottnest”, but we needed less t’s….Your task now is to finish the class FrequencyDecryption. We have written many of the methods for you– you only need to write getKey and printTaskDescription.What could the secret message say?INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20168Example OutputThe secret message is:Well, we can’t tell you what the secret message is in the example output, butit should be in this form at least. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah etc.Setting UpSetting up your workspaceIn Eclipse, create a project “info1103_task3”. In this project, create a package “cryptography”. Then, createthree classes within this package: Encrypter, SecretMessages and FrequencyDecryption.Downloading the skeleton codeDownload the skeleton code from PASTA for these three classes. Then, you can either import these classes,or copy and paste the skeleton code into each of the classes you made.Methods to completeTake a quick look at the skeleton code. You’ll notice that, in some methods, there is one of the followingcomments://TODO complete this method//TODO complete this constructorThese are the methods that you will need to write for this assignment. You don’t need to modify any of themethods that don’t have one of these comments – we have already done these for you!NOTE: we recommend that you read the rest of the task description before you start writing any of themethods!!INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 20169Methods already return values!You might notice that, in some of the methods you need to complete, we have added a return statement tothe skeleton code. For example,public String getKey(){return “”; //TODO delete this when you write this method}This has been done to make your code compile. That way, you can submit to PASTA even if you haven’twritten some of the methods.When you start writing a method, delete this return statement and replace it with your own code.Method headersEach method has a header, such as:public boolean setKey(String newKey)Please do not modify these headers at all because we use them to test your code.Additional methodsYou are welcome to add any additional methods to the skeleton code if you would like to.Method CommentsFinally, you’ll notice there are blue comments above each method, which describe what each method does,what the parameters should be, and what the method will return depending on the input. Before writing anymethods, it’s very important to read these comments carefully, so you can make sure your method does exactlywhat it should!Submission InstructionsSubmitting in PASTA1. Before submitting, you should zip your source code files. Open the folder containing the classesEncrypter.java, SecretMessages.java and FrequencyDecryption.java. If you havetrouble finding the src folder, first find and open your workspace folder. Then, open the folder“info1103_task3”. The src folder will be inside. Navigate into the src folder, right click on the“cryptography” folder and choose “Send to -&gt; Compressed (Zipped) folder”.2. Log in to PASTA (http://info1103.it.usyd.edu.au/) with your Unikey login and password.Note: If you are off-campus, you will need to establish a VPN connection to access PASTA. This means installinga program called “VPN client” on your computer and running it every time when you use PASTA off-campus.Instructions how to do this are available here:INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 201610http://staff.ask.sydney.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/519/~/how-do-i-download-and-install-the-vpn-client-to-access-the-university-network%3FIf you have problems with VPN, try synchronising your password:https://www.auth.usyd.edu.au/extro/pwresync/If this doesn’t work, contact the ICT helpdesk: http://sydney.edu.au/ict/student/contact/3. Find Task 3 and press “Submit”. Then press “Choose File” and attach the zipped source files, thenpress “I accept” (after reading the University policy on academic honesty).4. If you see a message indicating that your code is queued for testing under Task 3, this means that yourcode has been uploaded successfully.5. If you see a red error box, you need to fix any problems indicated before your submission will beaccepted.6. Once your program has been tested, the page will tell you to refresh for results, so refresh the page.You should see green, red and grey boxes. Each box corresponds to a test; a red box indicates that yourprogram has failed the respective test, a green box indicates that your program has passed the test, anda grey box indicates that the test is hidden (you will not see the result of the test until after the duedate).7. If you have red boxes, you can see which tests were not passed by clicking on the task name. Correctthe errors (go to Eclipse, re-write your code and test it carefully) and then submit again in PASTA.8. For further help on using PASTA, check the INFO1103 User Manual, or post a question on Piazza.You can submit as many times as you want. Please make sure that your program compiles and runs beforeyou submit it in PASTA. Your last submission will be the one that will be marked.Marking5 marks will be allocated for the Encrypter and SecretMessages classes (core part of the task) and 2marks for the FrequencyDecryption (extension part of the task).Your mark is the percentage of the tests that you have passed. For example, if you pass half of the tests for thecore part of the task and all of the tests for the extension, you will receive 50% of 5 marks + 100% of 2 marks= 4.5 marks total. If you do not attempt the extension part of the test, the maximum mark you can get is 5/7.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"Python代写：Introduction to Computer Programming with Python","slug":"page41","date":"2016-11-16T01:11:23.000Z","updated":"2017-01-04T04:01:50.296Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/16/page41/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/16/page41/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction一个天气数据的处理系统，需要用到array，在线的API接口，数据异常处理等等，根据获取的天气数据做相关处理（增删改查统计等等），最后还有sample run的示例辅助测试。RequirementCS 8: Introduction to Computer Programming with PythonSpring 2016Project 2Assigned: Wednesday, February 24 Due: Tuesday, March 29 11:59 PMOverviewBlackjack, or 21, is the most widely-played casino banking game in the world. The goal isto build a hand of cards that values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. First,here is the terminology used in the game. Hit: Take another card for your hand Stand: Stop taking cards Bust: Exceed a value of 21 in your hand Push: Tie with the dealerThe cards are valued as follows.Rank ValueAce 11 or 12–10 Face valueJack, Queen, King 10Of particular note, an Ace can be considered either value 11 or 1. Given rational strategy,it will be considered 11 unless that will cause a bust, in which case it will be considered 1.In each hand, play proceeds as follows.1. The dealer takes one card, which the player can see.2. The player is given two cards.3. The player has the option to hit, or take one additional card. The player can hit asmany times as desired, until they reach or exceed 21, or decide to stand (stop takingcards).14. If the player did not bust (exceed 21), the dealer takes cards until she reaches 17 orhigher (i.e., the dealer will hit on 16 or fewer points, and stand on 17 or more points).5. If the player busts, she immediately loses, and the dealer will not draw more cards.If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it isa push. Otherwise, the winner is the one with higher point total.6. If the player loses, she loses her bet. If the player wins, she wins her bet. If the handis a push, the bet is returned (i.e., no gain or loss).In this project, you will program a functional Blackjack game by first coding the basic logicof the game, then gradually adding features.2Lab Session 1, Feb 24–Feb 25Activity 1In this activity, you will code the logic of the game using simplifications, rather than tacklinga full Blackjack game all at once. Instead of selecting a card and then determining its value,you will instead randomly generate a card’s value from between 2 and 11. You will alsoassume that the bet is always $25.Note that randomly generating a card’s value is not an accurate way to simulate draws. In areal deck, there are more cards worth 10 than there are, e.g., cards worth 5. Consider otherways in which this version of Blackjack will not be exactly the same as real-life Blackjack.You will add features to make the game more realistic in later activities.1. Write a main() function that asks the user for their name, and initializes their startingmoney to $1,000.2. Write a loop in main() that will play a hand of blackjack, then ask the user if they wantto play another hand (as long as they still have money to bet). You will play a handby calling the play_hand(name) function (which does not yet exist). This functionshould return the change in the player’s money (positive if they win, negative if theylose), and you should use this value to update their amount after each hand.3. Write the play_hand(name) function. In this function, you will need to track therunning total of the cards that the dealer and player have been dealt. Deal one cardto the dealer and two to the player. Prompt the player for their action (hit/stay)until they reach or exceed 21, or choose to stay. Then, deal cards to the dealer untilthey reach or exceed 17. Determine the winner, and return the change in the player’smoney (i.e., 25 if they won, -25 if they lost, and 0 if the hand was a push).Here is an example run after completing this stage:Name? BillBill has $1,000Dealer received card of value 2Bill received card of value 9Bill received card of value 5Dealer total: 2Bill total: 14Move?

(y/n) nOnce you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.5Activity 2In this activity, you will improve the drawing of cards. You will use the strategy we’velearned in lecture for encoding information in a way that the computer can store it: trans-form the information into a number. In this activity, use an integer to store each card, andrepresent them as follows.Rank int encoding Point valueAce (A) 1 112 2 23 3 34 4 45 5 56 6 67 7 78 8 89 9 910 10 10Jack (J) 11 10Queen (Q) 12 10King (K) 13 10Now, you can randomly generate a card from Ace to King, rather than randomly generatinga value. You will modify your program so that you can determine how to display each card,as well as what value it has.1. Write a function value_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encodedcard as described above (i.e., an int value from 1 to 13) and returns its point value asdescribed above.2. Write a function string_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encodedcard as described above and returns the card’s string value for printing during thegame.For example, string_of_card(5) should return “5”, and string_of_card(12) (aQueen) should return “Q”.3. Modify the play_hand function to generate a random card, rather than a random cardvalue. When adding a card to the player or dealer’s total, use value_of_card(card),and when displaying a card, use string_of_card(card).Here is an example run after completing this stage:Name? Bill6Bill has $1,000Dealer received 2Bill received ABill received KDealer total: 2Bill total: 21Dealer received ADealer total: 13Bill total: 21Dealer received 9Dealer total: 22Bill total: 21Dealer bustBill has $1,025Play again?

(y/n) nOnce you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.7Lab Session 2, Mar 2–Mar 3Activity 3In this activity, you will save the player’s game and allow them to resume. You will use fileI/O as discussed in lecture. You will save and restore the player’s name and money total.1. Write a function save(name, money) that saves the user’s name and money to thefile blackjack.save.Hint: In order to restore this information successfully, you should save these twopieces of information on separate lines of the file.2. Write a function restore() that attempts to read the user’s name and money fromthe file blackjack.save. If it is successful, it should return these values as a string andan int, respectively. If it fails, it should return ‘’, -1 to indicate it was unsuccessful.3. Modify function main() to call save(name, money) before quitting.4. Modify function main() to call restore() when starting up. If the load was successful,ask the user if they would like to resume or start a new game. If it was unsuccessful,simply start a new game.Here is an example run after completing this stage (nothing has changed yet, because thereis no saved game to load):Name? BillBill has $1,000Dealer received KBill received QBill received 3Dealer total: 10Bill total: 13Move? (hit/stay) hBill received 4Dealer total: 10Bill total: 17Move?

(y/n) nOnce you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.10Activity 4In this activity, you will allow the player to change their bet before each hand.1. Write a function input_bet(bet, money) that accepts parameter for the current betand amount of money available, and returns the bet input from the user. Performinput validation on the following requirements:The bet must be a whole number, cannot be negative, and cannot be greater than theavailable money. If the user presses enter without typing anything, use the existingbet value (if valid). The user can bet 0, which means they want to quit the game.2. Modify main() to call input_bet(bet, money) before every hand instead of prompt-ing for y/n for another hand. If the user bets 0, save their game and quit.Now, you will need to pass the current bet to the play_hand function, and modifythis function so it returns the correct change in the player’s money when they win orlose.Here is an example run after completing this stage:Name? BillBill has $1,000Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 1500Cannot bet more than $1,000Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) FiftyBet?

(hit/stay) hBill received ADealer total: 11Bill total: 26Bill bustBill has $0Game overOnce you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.12Lab Session 3, Mar 16–Mar 17Activity 5In this activity, you will improve the card drawing functionality even further. In real life,you cannot draw 5 Aces in a single hand. However, if we’re only generating random cards,this is possible. Therefore, for each hand, you will create a deck of cards, shuffle it, anddraw from it.1. Write a function new_deck() that returns a list containing 4 Kings, 4 Queens, etc.using the integer encoding from Activity 2.Hint: Use nested loops.2. Write a function shuffle_deck(deck) that returns a shuffled version of the deck.Hint: Use the random module.3. Modify play_hand() so that it creates and shuffles a deck at the start of each hand.Instead of randomly generating cards, “draw” them from the shuffled deck. Be surethat you do not draw the same card from the deck multiple times (e.g., by removingthe card you draw from the deck).Unless you know how to count cards, the output after this activity will not look verydifferent. However, your distribution of cards will be more realistic. You should run yourprogram to ensure that you are still getting random-looking cards, and not drawing thesame cards over and over again.Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.13Activity 6In this activity, you will modify your encoding of cards so that it stores both the rank (A–K)and the suit (♣, ♦, ♥, ♠).1. Modify new_deck() so that it creates a list of cards where each card is a tuple of size2. Store the int value first, then a string value representing the suit.Hint: You may be able to copy and paste the suit symbols directly into your texteditor. If not, you can use the following escape sequences to include the suit symbolsin a string literal in Python.Suit Escape sequence♣ \\u2663♦ \\u2662♥ \\u2661♠ \\u26602. Modify value_of_card to account for the change in encoding of cards.3. Modify the string_of_card to print both the rank and suit of the card.Here is an example run after completing this stage:Name? BillBill has $1,000Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100Dealer received 10♦Bill received 6♦Bill received 2♠Dealer total: 10Bill total: 8Move?

(0 to quit, Enter to stay at $100) 0Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.15Lab Session 4, Mar 23–Mar 24Activity 7In this activity, you will modify your program to improve its output. Instead of keepingtrack of only the total points of the player and dealer, you will keep track of their full handas a list of cards.1. Write function string_of_hand(hand) that uses the string_of_card(card) func-tion to return a string of an entire hand (encoded as a list of cards).2. Write function value_of_hand(hand) that uses the value_of_card(card) functionto return the value of an entire hand of cards.3. Modify the function play_hand so that it keeps track of the hands of the player anddealer, rather than just the total points for their hand. Then modify your output sothat it prints the hands instead of individual cards.4. Modify your function value_of_hand(hand) so that it correctly adds the value ofAce.Recall the rule: if an Ace of value 11 would make the hand bust, it is considered tobe value 1 instead. Thus, an Ace alone is worth 11, an Ace and a King is worth 21,and two Aces is worth 12.Hint: It may help to create a list of values for each card. For example, if the userhas two Aces, first create the list of values [11, 11], then modify it according to therule.Here is an example run after completing this stage:Name? BillBill has $1,000Bet?

Links will be provided on the eLP forelectronic submission of your work.Marking and feedback will be available within the following 3 weeks in classor via an appointment, or via e-mail.Weighting towards Module 70%Learning Objectives Covered The following learning objectives are eitherfully or partially covered by this assignment:1. Analyse and specify a programming problem.2. Design a high-level solution to the problem using object oriented andgeneral imperative programming language constructs.3. Write, compile, execute, test and debug an OO program, which maps thehigh-level design onto concrete programming constructs, using appropriatedocumentation standards and software tools.4. Critically evaluate the methodologies and conceptual tools used in devel-oping solutions to programming problems.The two main themes of this assignment are programming graphical user inter-faces in Java and using inheritence in Java.The work is set in week 9 of the module by which time you will have coveredthe key concepts required to complete the work. However, you may find thatsome of the material discussed after the Easter Vacation may be of use in yourimplementation of the program.1Problem SpecificationYou are going to provide a version of the loans recording system (assignment 1)with a GUI and some extra functionality.The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items forloan. The system should hold a price and a number in stock for a sale-item,and a borrower and a return-date for a loan item. Thus there will be two typesof Item in the collection.1. LoanItem: consisting of item ID and item description plus a borrower anda return date; the ID consists of the letters LN followed by a three-digitnumber;2. SaleItem: consisting of item ID and description plus a price and a numberin stock; the ID consists of the letters SL followed by a three-digit number;You are provided with two classes as a starting point for the work:• Item a class representing a single item entry in the system. This classcontains only the ID and description; you will need to extend it to includethe extra data (borrower name and loan date (a long integer) in case ofLoanItem and description and quantity in case of SaleItem).• ItemCollection a class representing the collection of item records, andcontaining functions to save the item data (in text format) to a data file,and to load item data from the file.There is also a sample data file, containing IDs and descriptions only, and aMain.class which illustrates loading from the data file into the item collection,and saving of the item collection to the data file. More on these classes below.RequirementsThe following are essential functional requirements of the program:1. The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as itemsfor loan, as above.• The Item class needs to be extended to classes LoanItem (record-ing borrower and return data as per assignment 1) and SaleItem,recording price and number in stock in addition to ID, description.• The ItemCollection class needs to be extended also.The ExtendedItemCollection class will inherit the ArrayListand use this to store the two types of Item in one list, but will needextra methods to support the functions set out below.2In particular, the Items in the collection will be a mixture of LoanItemsand SaleItems; your code needs to be able to distinguish these.2. Your program should provide the following functions -(a) issue a loan-item on loan;(b) check back in a loan-item;(c) sell some quantity of a sale-item (and update of the number in stock);(d) list all entries;(e) list all loan-item entries;(f) list all loan-items currently on loan;(g) list all sale-item entries;3. The user interface must be a GUI.Figure 1: A GUI for the applicationGeneral Points1. You must make use of inheritance in developing this program. This shouldinvolve you in extending the given Item and ItemCollection classes. Al-3though you may be given the source files, your program you MUST NOTmake any changes to these files.2. All interactions must be via a GUI. Typically you can expect to make useof buttons, text areas, and text fields. Your GUI should look somethinglike that depicted in figure 1.3. The program should consist of a number of classes each with well definedfunctionality. There should be a driver class to set things going; a GUIclass to provide the user interface; classes concerned with the addressbook.4. Your program should deal with error conditions by producing an errordialogue window when the use makes a mistake (Consider the use of JOp-tionPane dialogues for the error dialogues. This will require a little inves-tigation on your part.)5. Input could be via the ‘generic’ dialogues provided by JOptionPane; oryou could try making your own custom dialogues extending JDialog class.6. All classes must be fully documented using Javadoc conventions.7. The code you produce must adhere to the published course coding stan-dards. Failure to adhere to the standards will lead to a loss of marks.8. You will be expected to test your program against a suitable set of sit-uations. In the documentation you should describe your testing strategy(see below).DesignYou must produce design documentation. This will include a class diagram forthe system, a short explanation as to the general purpose of each of the classesyou have produced and their key methods; and a justification for any designdecisions you have made.ImplementationYou must provide listings for your program. The code must adhere to the Javastyle standards as defined for the module.TestingYou are expected to test your code. During the module we looked at strategiesfor testing programs. You must apply these strategies to your work.4The testing section of your documentation indicates the approach you havetaken to verifying and validating your system. Just as you should not conveythe design of your system by presenting the code or even listing the classes,you should not merely list the tests performed. Rather, discuss how tests wereselected, why they are sufficient, why a reader should believe that no importanttests were omitted, and why the reader should believe that the system will reallyoperate as desired when in use.1. Strategy: An explanation of the overall strategy for testing: Black boxand/or white box, integration, kinds of test beds or test drivers used,sources of test data, test suites. You might want to use different techniques(or combinations of techniques) in different parts of the program. In eachcase, justify your decisions.2. Test Data: A set of tables showing the test data you used for each class,etc. The format of the test documentation should be as follows: for eachtest case in the tables,• a unique ID• a brief description of the purpose of the test• the pre-conditions for running the test• the test data• the expected resultReflectionYou must provide a final critical evaluation of your work.The reflection section is where you can generalize from specific failures or suc-cesses to rules that you or others can use in future software development. Whatsurprised you most? What do you wish you knew when you started? How couldyou have avoided problems that you encountered during development?1. Evaluation: What you regard as the successes and failures of the devel-opment: unresolved design problems, performance problems, etc. Identifywhich features of your design are the important ones. Point out designor implementation techniques that you are particularly proud of. Dis-cuss what mistakes you made in your design, and the problems that theycaused.2. Lessons: What lessons you learned from the experience: how you mightdo it differently a second time round, and how the faults of the design andimplementation may be corrected. Describe factors that caused problemssuch as missed milestones or to the known bugs and limitations.53. Known Bugs and Limitations: In what ways does your implementationfall short of the specification? Be precise. Although you will lose pointsfor bugs and missing features, you will receive partial credit for accuratelyidentifying those errors, and the source of the problem.This should be 1 to 2 pages long.DeliverablesYou are expected to submit the following items:1. Your working Java classes, source code and project files (if approriate).JUnit test classes and sources should be included. Your Java source codeshould(a) be fully commented in the JavaDoc style;(b) adhere to the defined coding standards.2. a .jar file containing your application classes.3. The HTML documentation produced by JavaDoc.4. A report containing the following sections:(a) A cover page giving your name, University ID, and module details;(b) Design documentation as outlined above;(c) All the test documentation outlned above;(d) Your reflection and critical evaluation, as outlined above(e) Brief instructions on running your program (this will not be marked);Submission is electronic. Electronic Copies of your work should be sub-mitted via the assignment mechanism on the eLP (Blackboard). Separate linkswill be provided for (1) a ZIP containing your java source, classes, etc, yourjar file and your Javadoc-generted documentation; and (2) your report, in PDFformat.Academic integrityYou must adhere to the university regulations on academic conduct. Formalinquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of plagiarism orany other form of misconduct in your work. Refer to the Universitys AssessmentRegulations for Northumbria Awards if you are unclear as to the meaning ofthese terms. The latest copy is available on the University website.6Classes ProvidedYour have been given the following .class files from which you will build yournew system:• Entry.class• AddressBook.classThe documentation for each class is also provided but you should not count onseeing the source code. It is intended that you use the functionality providedby these classes without modifying them in any way.To use these classes1. In BlueJ create the project for the assignment2.

It just checksif the received file is exactly the same as the sent one in respective test cases.• [2 points] (Who runs faster?) Time taken for your programs to transfer an enormous file(more than 10MB) in the presence of both packet corruption and packet loss will be noteddown. The fastest batch of student programs will receive 2 marks and slower programs thatare still faster than average will receive 1 mark. JYou may apply the knowledge gained from this or other courses as appropriate. However,since the objective of this assignment is to design a fast network transmission protocol,you are NOT allowed to play tricks (e.g., data compression) to gain unfair advantageover your peers. Please consult the teaching team if you are unsure if certain techniquescan be used or not.A Word of AdviceThis assignment is complex and time-consuming. You are suggested to write programsincrementally and modularly. For example, deal with data packet corruption first, then ACKpacket corruption, then data packet loss, etc. Test your programs after every single majorchange. Take note that partial credit will be awarded even if your programs don’t meet all listedrequirements.Page 3 of 6Overall ArchitectureThere are three programs in this assignment, FileSender, UnreliNET andFileReceiver. Their relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The FileSender andFileReceiver programs implement a file transfer application over UDP protocol. TheUnreliNET program simulates the transmission channel that transmits packets unreliably andrandomly corrupts or loses packets. However, for simplicity, you can assume that this channelalways delivers packets in order.Figure 1: UnreliNet Simulates Unreliable NetworkThe UnreliNET program acts as a proxy between FileSender and FileReceiver.Instead of sending packets directly to FileReceiver, FileSender sends all packets toUnreliNET. UnreliNET may introduce bit errors to packets or lose packets randomly. Itthen forwards packets (if not lost) to FileReceiver. When receiving feedback packets fromFileReceiver, UnreliNET may also corrupt them or lose them with certain probabilitybefore relaying them to FileSender.The UnreliNET program is complete and given. Your task in this assignment is to develop theFileSender and FileReceiver programs so that a file can be successfully transferredfrom sender to receiver in the presence of possible packet corruption and packet loss. Thereceived file should be identical to the file sent. You may need to implement techniques learntin lecture, including sequence number, acknowledgement, timeout and retransmission, toensure that packets are correctly delivered.FileSender ClassThe FileSender program is basically a file uploader that opens a given file and sends itscontent as a sequence of packets to UnreliNet. UnreliNet would then corrupt/losepackets with certain probability before relaying them to the FileReceiver program.To run FileSender on sunfire, type command:java FileSender For example:java FileSender ../test/cny.mp3 localhost 9000 gxfc.mp3sends the file cny.mp3 from directory (relative path) ../test to UnreliNet running inthe same host at port 9000. UnreliNet will then pass the file to your FileReceiverprogram to be stored as gxfc.mp3.UnreliNET FileSender FileReceiverPage 4 of 6(Note: Windows system uses a different file separator ‘\\’, e.g., ..\\test\\cny.mp3)You may assume that during testing, your sender program will be supplied with the correctpath and filename (no more than 100 bytes long). No input validation is needed.UnreliNET ClassThe UnreliNET program simulates an unreliable channel that may corrupt or lose packetswith a certain probability. This program is given and shouldn’t be changed.To run UnreliNET on sunfire, type command:java UnreliNET For example:java UnreliNET 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 9000 localhost 9001listens on port 9000 and forwards all received data packets to FileReceiver running on thesame host at port 9001, with 30% chance of packet corruption and 10% chance of packet loss.The UnreliNET program also forwards ACK/NAK packets to FileSender, with 20% packetcorruption rate and 5% packet loss rate.Packet Corruption ProbabilityThe UnreliNET program randomly corrupts or loses data packets and ACK/NAK packetsaccording to the specified parameters P_DATA_CORRUPT, P_ACK_CORRUPT P_ACK_LOSS andP_ACK_LOSS. You can set these values to anything in the range [0, 0.3] during testing (setting atoo large corruption/loss rate may result in a very slow file transmission).If you have trouble getting your code to work, it might be advisable to set them to 0 first fordebugging purposes.FileReceiver ClassThe FileReceiver program receives a file from FileSender (through UnreliNET) andsaves it in the same directory as the FileReceiver program, with a filename specified byFileSender.To run FileReceiver on sunfire, type command:java FileReceiver For example:java FileReceiver 9001listens on port 9001 and dumps the bytes received into a file whose name is given by sender.Page 5 of 6Running All Three ProgramsYou should first launch FileReceiver, followed by UnreliNET in the second window.Finally, launch FileSender in a third window to start data transmission. All programs shouldreceive user input from command-line argument only. Please always test your programs inlocalhost to avoid the interference of network traffic on your programs.The UnreliNET program simulates unreliable communication network and runs infinitely.Once launched, you may reuse it in consecutive tests. To manually terminate it, press + c.The UnreliNET program prints out information that is helpful in debugging your programs.However, we will disable such outputs in speed test.The sender and receiver programs shouldn’t communicate with each other directly – all trafficshould be forwarded by the UnreliNET program. The sender program should terminateproperly (e.g., no exception, no infinite loop) once transmission finishes. However, you mayleave the receiver program running infinitely (i.e., no need for receiver to detect end oftransmission and terminate, but DO remember to close the file output stream at the end).Self-defined Header/Trailer Fields at Application LayerUDP transmission is unreliable. To detect packet corruption or packet loss, you may need toimplement reliability checking and recovery mechanisms at application layer. The followingheader/trailer fields are suggested though you may have your own design: Sequence number ChecksumNote that each packet FileSender sends should contain at most 1000 bytes of applicationdata (inclusive of self-defined header/trailer fields), or UnreliNET program will reject it.Computing ChecksumTo detect bit errors, FileSender should compute checksum for every outgoing packet andembed it in the packet. FileReceiver needs to re-compute checksum to verify the integrityof a received packet.Please refer to Assignment 0 Exercise 3 on how to compute checksum using Java CRC32 class.Timer and Timeout ValueSender may have to maintain a timer for unacknowledged packet. You are suggested to use thesetSoTimeout() method of Java Socket class.You shouldn’t set a timeout value that is larger than 200ms, or your program might be too slowin transmitting data and thus get killed by the grading script.Page 6 of 6Reading/Writing Values to Header/Trailer FieldsThe number of header/trailer fields and the sequence of their appearance in a packet is theagreement between sender and receiver (i.e. an application layer protocol designed by you).As discussed in tutorial 3, to give value to a header field of a 4-byte integer, you may considerByteBuffer class from java.nio package. An example is shown below.At sender side:int length = 1000;// allocate a 4-byte array to store converted integerbyte[] pktLen = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(length).array();// copy content of pktLen to the beginning of output buffer of pktSystem.arraycopy(pktLen, 0, buffer, 0, pktLen.length);At receiver side:// extract the first 4 bytes of a packet as the integer ‘length’ByteBuffer wrapper = ByteBuffer.wrap(pkt.getData(), 0, 4);int length = wrapper.getInt();","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Network/"}]},{"title":"C代写：Chat Room","slug":"page37","date":"2016-11-12T13:22:33.000Z","updated":"2017-01-04T03:53:16.980Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/12/page37/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/12/page37/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction用c语言写一个多人聊天室，大致要求就是做一个能够实现自由加入和退出的聊天室。 一个人发送信息其他人都能收到，消息发送成功要有个提示。每个人加入和退出也会有提示，前面的英文有举例。多人聊天的时候可以分辨出来那句话是谁发的。Requirementyou will implement a multi-user chat program.

When two instances of yourprogram are being run simultaneously on the system, a user typing in one instance will beable to send the message typed to the user running the other instance of the program.User interface can be a very simple one by using printf() and scanf() functions of the Cprogramming language. IPC mechanism is going to be developed using Message Queues.Important: You should design your code so that when the user is waiting to type amessage, at the same time messages are being retrieved from the queue if they arrive in it.This requires multi-threaded program.SpecificsIPC Introduction and namingUnder UNIX operating system, apart from pipes and signals as primitive type of IPC,from System V release new techniques were added: message queues, semaphores andshared memory. You can investigate the status of IPC facilities on the system by enteringipcs –b on the command prompt. IPC Message queues will exist even after the processcreating it terminates, thus it should be manually removed with the ipcrm –q command, since IPC resources on a system are limited.IPC system calls related to the Message Queues that is the mechanism of choice for theIPC are: msgget for allocating an IPC or gaining access to an existing queue. msgctl tocontrol an IPC, modify its status and/or remove it. Lastly, for sending and receivingmessages msgsnd and msgrcv are used.Once an IPC facility is created using the msgget function, an IPC identifier is returned bythe system. The user creating the IPC facility identified by the returned identifier shouldspecify the access permissions. Header defines the IPC permissions structurecalled: ipc_perm. Also, needs to be included in every program before thesys/ipc.h is included.The unique system-wide identifier identifies message queues. To create such an identifierof type key_t defined in the file, ftok() function should be used. If ftok() iscalled with the same arguments from two different processes, the same key would beproduced, thus two different processes would be able to access the same IPC facility.For example:key_t key;key = ftok(“.”, 123);First argument is the reference to an existing accessible file (in UNIX, file “.” – areference to the current directory is always available and accessible). Second argument issome integer, referred to as an id. There are also constants to be passed as an ID: forexample IPC_PRIVATE that assures that returned key is always unique.Creating Message QueueA message queue is created using the msgget system call. If successful, a non-negativeinteger is returned which is a message queue identifier that can be used in subsequentcalls that reference it. First parameter is the key returned by ftok(), and the secondparameter is the access permission that is of the same format as the chmod commandparameter. Passing 0777 would give read and write permissions to everyone on thesystem. To verify proper access permissions are made, once the queue is created, you canobserve set permissions with the ipcs –b command described at the beginning of thissection. Furthermore, use the IPC_CREAT flag ORed with the 0777 to assure that thequeue is created if it does not exist or if it already exist, an identifier to it is simplyreturned.For example:mq_handle = msgget(key, IPC_CREAT | 0777);if(mq_handle&lt;=-1) {printf(“Error creating message queue\\n”);perror(“MQ Sample”); / print the error /return(1);}Obtaining information about the message queueUsing the msgctl function and the IPC_STAT flag passed to it, information about thequeue, its owner, number of bytes on the queue, number of messages, etc…can beobtained. An include file needs also to be included in the program.For example:struct msqid_ds *info;int ret;…ret = msgctl(mq_handle, IPC_STAT, info);if(ret==-1) {printf(“Failed to obtain message queue information\\n”);perror(“MQ Sample”);exit(1); }printf(“# of messages on queue: %d\\n”, info-&gt;msg_qnum);Communicating through Message QueueA message is defined in the struct msgbuf in the include file . First field ofthe structure, mtype, is an user-defined positive integer id, agreed between the programsusing the message queue to selectively retrieve the messages from it. Suppose, 4programs (instances of the chat program) are using the same message queue, in that casethe following should be done to assure proper bi-directional communication:Instance 1 Instance 2 Instance 3 Instance 4Instance 1 – 12 13 14Instance 2 21 – 23 24Instance 3 31 32 – 34Instance 4 41 42 43 –For example:Instance 1 will use mtype=12 to send a message to the Instance 2 and also Instance 1 willretrieve messages that have mtype=21. Instance 2 will use mtype=12 to retrieve messagesfrom the queue from the Instance 1 and it will use mtype=21 to send a message to theInstance 1. Thus, we assure that there is a bi-directional communication on the samechannel (same message queue) that is shared by many instances of the same chat programand messages are not delivered to the wrong instance.msgsend()msgsend() takes four parameters and it returns 0 on success and –1 on failure setting theerrno global variable to a pre-specified number that can be examined to retrieve the error(or by using perror() function to get a meaningful message).First parameter is the identifier of the message queue. Second parameter is the pointer tothe actual message. Third parameter is the size of the message obtained by using thesizeof operator, and the last parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is one flag, whichcauses a non-blocking send (send would block if the queue was full) or a zero can bepassed if no flags are needed).msgrcv()msgrcv() takes five parameters. First one is the queue identifier. Second one is the pointerto where the received message will be placed (receiver’s end structure should have thefirst member as ulong to assure message type can be correctly written). Third one is themaximum size of the message that can be received. Fourth parameter specifies whichmessages should be received: an identifier used in mtype at the sender’s side or 0 toretrieve all messages. Fifth parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is to create a no-blocking receive and MSG_NOERROR is not to produce any error if the messagereceived is bigger than the maximum size specified. If MSG_NOERROR is not specifiedand message received is larger than the maximum specified size an error will occur.msgrcv() returns –1 on failure or number of bytes received if it is successful. On error, italso sets errno global variable able to be retrieved using perror().SubmissionYou should submit your C program on Carmen along with details on how to run it andanything else that would allow the grader to grade your work.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"},{"name":"unix","slug":"unix","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/unix/"}]},{"title":"C代写：Bonus Lab (Chat Program using Message Queues)","slug":"page36","date":"2016-11-11T14:32:43.000Z","updated":"2017-01-04T03:51:37.928Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/11/page36/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/11/page36/","excerpt":"","text":"Introductionc语言的纸牌游戏，规定用链表实现功能，包括创建4种花色，洗牌，发牌等功能的实现。最后还提供了sample方便测试，这个题目属于阶段性题目的一部分，以后还会有相应的扩展Requirement1ECE175 Computer Programming for Engineering ApplicationsHomework Assignment 8Due Date: Tuesday April 12, 2016 11:59 PM, via D2LConventions: Name your C programs as hwxpy.cwhere x corresponds to the homework number and y correspondto the problem number.Write comments to your programs.

In other words, for each of the foursuits, the cards should be in order from Ace (1) through King (13).each card is consisted ofsuit [clubs (♣),spades (♠),hearts (♥), or diamonds (♦))a face (1(Ace) – 10, Jacks (J), Queens (Q), and Kings (K))To simulate the deck, and each of the players’ hands, you MUST use a dynamic list ofcards with the following typetypedef struct card_s {char suit;int face;struct card_s *listp;} card;At the HW demo time, you will be asked to print the deck that you create.2) shuffle the deck (52 cards), using the following algorithm:(a) For each card in the deck, get a random number in the range of 0 to 50 to beused as the index of the element to swap that card with, i.e.if deck[0] holds the Jack of clubs (J ♣) and the random number generated was24, and deck[24] holds the 9 of diamonds (9♦), thenafter the first swap, deck[0] would hold the 9 of diamonds (9♦) and24] would hold the Jack of clubs (J ♣). You would then proceed todeck[1], find a random index of a card to swap with, and swap those cards,etc.(b) Repeat step (a) at least 100 times.Note: You must seed the random number generator with a call to time() withsrand(). [see sec 2.22 Random numbers in your Zyante book]At the HW demo time, you will be asked to print the deck after the shuffle is done.3) deal the cards (after shuffling the deck) by giving one card to the user/player,followed by one card to the computer/dealer, followed by one card to the2user/player, etc. until each player get 8 cards.

The purpose of this assignment is to get experience with• advanced data structures,• manipulation of pointers and C constructs,• dynamic allocation and and deallocation of memory,• organizing code in multiple files,• writing Makefile to compile your code.In this assignment, you are to write a C program to implement a sparse matrix structure(2D array) indexed by a pair of strings using binary search trees.Assignment basic requirements. The code should be well documented and logicallyorganized. The comments should be proper. Your code should be tested carefully beforesubmitting it, especially for boundary cases, such as empty data-structures. Avoid segmen-tation fault and memory leak.1 PreliminariesIn this assignment, you will implement the following data structures.Binary search treeThis will be implemented with pointers and structures. The key type is a pair of strings (apair of pointers to char) which will be used later as indices of the matrix structure. Thedata type can be any type and in this assignment it is float.The type definitions for key and data in C are the following.typedef float Data_Item;typedef char Sub_Key;typedef struct {Sub_Key key1; Sub_Key key2} Key;You will need a function to generate a key from a pair of strings, a function to print a key,a function to print a data, and a function to compare two keys.1int key_comp(Key key1, Key key2);Key key_gen(Sub_Key key1, Sub_Key key2);void key_print(Key key);void data_print(Data_Item data);The type definitions for binary search trees are the following:struct Bst_Node {Key key;Data_Item data;struct Bst_Node left, right;};typedef struct Bst_Node BStree_node;typedef BStree_node** BStree;The operations for binary search trees are the following.BStree bs_tree_ini(void);Allocate memory of type BStree node, set the value to NULL, and return a pointer to theallocated memory.void bs_tree_insert(BStree bst, Key key, Data_Item data);Insert data with key into bst. If key is in bst, then do nothing.Data_Item bs_tree_search(BStree bst, Key key);If key is in bst, return a pointer to key’s associated data. If key is not in bst, returnNULL.void bs_tree_traversal(BStree bst);In order traversal of bst and print each node’s key and data.void bs_tree_free(BStree bst);Free all the dynamically allocated memory of bst.A Matrix Indexed by a pair of StringsThe matrix structure will be implemented as Matrix using BStree.The type definition in C is the following.typedef BStree Matrix;typedef Sub_Key Index;The operations are the following.Matrix matrix_construction(void);Matrix construction using bs tree ini();Data_Item matrix_get(Matrix m, Index index1, Index index2);2If at location (index1, index2) in Matrix m, the value is defined, then return a pointer tothe associated data. Otherwise, return NULL.void matrix_set(Matrix m, Index index1, Index index2, Data_Item data);Assign data to Matrix m at location (index1, index2).void matrix_listing(Matrix m);Print values in the Matrix m (with bs tree traversal()).void matrix_destruction(Matrix m);Free allocated space (with bs tree free()).2 Organizing the code into multiple filesFor this assignment you are to organize the code in the following way:• In the file datatype.h, define the type Data Item, the type Sub Key, the type Key, anddeclare prototypes of the functions for type Data Item and type Key.• In the file datatype.c, implement the functions for type Data Item and type Key.• In the file bs tree.h, define the type BStree node, the type BStree and declare proto-types of the operations on BStree.• In the file bs tree.c, implement the functions on BStree.• In the file matrix.h, define the type Index and the type Matrix and declare prototypesof the operations on Matrix.• In the file matrix.c, implement the functions on Matrix.• In the file main.c, your program will1. create a new Matrix.2. read from stdin, or redirect from a file, string pairs (a pair of strings, i.e. twostrings, per line) and then calculate occurrences of each string pair read using theMatrix created.3. print the data in the Matrix4. free all allocated memory spaces for the Matrix and terminate.A sample input is given below.bba aaaab aabbba aaaab abbbba aaa3A sample output is given below.String 1 String 2 Occurrenceaab aab 1aab abb 1bba aa 2bba aaa 13 Creating a Makefile to compile the source codeYou are asked to create a Makefile to compile your source code. When “make” is typed,an executable program called “mymatrix” is generated. Typing “make clean” cleans all thefiles generated by “gcc”.4 Testing your programYou should implement BStree first and then test it to make sure it is correct before imple-menting Matrix.Your program should have no segmentation fault, no memory leak. Your program shouldprint all the elements correctly.You should test your program by running it on Gaul.

In this project, a simple andeffective inventory management and record system is developed in order to record, search andback up the data of various items in the company. To avoid any conflict between different datatypes and any other programming bugs, Input data validation processes are necessary to beemployed and developed in the system.1.1) File Format for data storage:In this project, one data file “inventory.txt” is required to back up the data. The “inventory.txt”file contains various data for each item (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status). In this project, we assume that the maximumnumbers of item records are 50 and the maximum numbers of characters for name of item,recipient, destination and delivery status) are 30.The format and example of data stored in the data file “inventory.txt” are listed as follows:Name of item #1Item number #1Subject #1Weight #1Quantity #1Recipient #1Final Destination #1Delivery Status #1Name of item #2Item number #2Subject #2Weight #2Quantity #2Recipient #2Final Destination #2Delivery Status #2Name of item #3Item number #3Subject #3Weight #3Quantity #3Recipient #3Final Destination #3Delivery Status #3...ICP Project 15-162 / 6The example of items records stored in the data file is listed as follows:Net Wi-Fi Router1001Electronics2.0 kg1Chan Tai ManKowloon BayDeliveryFujo Apple Gift SetFood25521.2kg1Cheung Wai MingYuen LongArrivalKoppo Men JacketFashion30030.5kg2Lee Siu YuSha TinWarehouse...ICP Project 15-163 / 62) Project RequirementsIn this project, students are required to form groups in the same class (4 to max. 5 students pergroup) to develop a C program (Standalone Console-Based Application) for the inventorymanagement and record system. The C program for this system must include two parts: (1) BasicFunctions (group part), and (2) Extra Functions (individual part).The example of Basic Functions (group part) of the system is shown as follows:2.1) Requirements for Basic Function (Group Part)The following functions must be supported in the system: Main Menu: in the main() functiono Show menu page when the program is executed or selected option is completed.o After the main menu is shown, wait for user to input a number (or character) fromoptions above. Option ‘1’: Add new item record(s)o Add a new item in the system and store the information of such item in a data file“inventory.txt”.o Record “Name of item”, “Item number”, “Subject”, “Weight”, “Quantity”, “Recipient”,“Final destination” and “Delivery status”.o Ask user to add another new item (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu page).ICP Project 15-164 / 6 Option ‘2’: Display item(s)o Load and display the items in the system from the corresponding data file“inventory.txt”.o Display all the item information (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status) line by line on screen. Option ‘3’: Modify item record(s)o Update the existing item record and store it to the corresponding data file.o Ask user to change another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menupage). Option ‘4’: Delete item record(s)o Delete the existing item record and update the records in the data file.o Ask user to remove another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menupage). Option ‘5’: Search item informationo Search and display the item information you searched on screen from the correspondingdata file “invenotory.txt”.o Ask user to search another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menupage).2.2) Requirements for Extra Function (Individual Part)Each group member is required to develop an extra function (e.g. create a new Option ‘6’ or a newfunction, etc.) and integrate to the system for this project. These extra functions can be contributedand integrated to the system so as to perform various specific tasks or related purposes.

You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks fromthe due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction forfailure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA thatyour program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺(90 pts) Implementation: Problem StatementYou will write a program to play blackjack using C++ classes. Blackjack is a cardgame that has a dealer and 1 or more players who are trying to get a hand closest to 21without going over. Aces can be 1 or 11, whichever is to your advantage, and all facevalue cards (Jack, Queen and King) have a value of 10.The players begin with a specific amount of money, and only the players can betagainst the dealer. First, everyone decides how much he/she wants to bet. Then,everyone is dealt 2 cards face up, and the dealer gets one face up and one face down.Each player decides whether to receive another card or not without going over 21. Ifthe player goes over 21 (or busts), then he/she immediately loses their bet from theirtotal playing money. After all players finish receiving cards, then the dealer turns overthe card that is facing down, and the dealer must receive a new card if the total is below17 and stay/hold if the total is 17 or above. The players with totals over 21 immediately lose their bet from their playing total. If the dealer goes over 21, then the players with 21 and under all win their bet,which is added to their playing total. If the dealer is 21 or under, then the players with card totals less than the dealerlose their bet from their playing total, and those players with card totals greaterthan the dealer win their bet, which is added to their playing total. Players who have the same card total as the dealer neither win nor lose, theirplaying total remains unchanged. Players who have a card total of 21, blackjack, win 1.5% their bet to their playingtotal.You will be required to have the following classes and members. However, youmay add more members and functions, based on your design. You will make .cppfiles for each class, .h, interface file. Make sure you include the correct .h fileswith the .cpp files.//card.h interface fileclass card {private:int value; //1-13char suit; //4 each: club, spade, heart, diamondpublic://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};//deck.h interface fileclass deck {private:card cards[52];int num_cards;public://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};//hand.h interface fileclass hand {private:card cards;int num_cards;public://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};//player.h interface fileclass player {private:hand p_hand;int playing_total;int card_total;int bet;public://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};//dealer.h interface fileclass dealer {private:hand d_hand;int card_total;public://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};//game.h interface fileclass game {private:deck cards;player players;dealer game_dealer;int num_players;public://must have constructors//must have destructors//must have accessor functions//must have mutator functions};Your program must be able to: Setup a deck of 52 cards with spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts of 2-10, Jack,Queen, King, and Ace for each suit. Shuffle the deck of cards before playing any game. Determine how many players and the playing total for each. Make sure that a player’s bet is less than or equal to the playing total. Determine when a full deck has been dealt, and reshuffle. You should not have any memory leaks in your program.Extra Credit (10 pts):In blackjack, if a player starts with doubles (cards with the same value), then the cardscan be split into different hands. The player is given two cards, one for each hand, andthe dealer now gets two cards for a different hand. After the first hand is played, thenthe second hand is played between the dealer and the player who split.(10 pts) Program Style/CommentsIn your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments!

Your job is to convince the TA that yourprogram works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺During your time in programming, you will undoubtedly run into a situation where youwill need to go through information more than once or need to perform the same taskover and over. The way we as programmers accomplish this is through the use ofloops and functions.(90 pts) Implementation: Problem StatementYou will write a program to compare state and county information. You musthave the following structs in your program.struct county {string name; //name of countystring city; //name of cities in countyint cities; //number of cities in countyint population; //total population of countyfloat avg_income; //avg household incomefloat avg_house; //avg household price};struct state {string name; //name of statestruct county c; //name of countiesint counties; //number of counties in stateint population; //total population of state};You will receive the number of states and filename from the user as command-linearguments. The number supplied with the –s option is the number of states to becreated and the text following the –f option is the filename with the state/countyinformation: a.out –s 2 –f states1.txtThis would create a dynamic array of 2 states on the heap, and you would read the restof the information about the state and counties from a file. Each line in the file willcontain the information for each state and county in the following order:State_name state_pop #_countycounty_name county_pop county_income county_house #_cities city_nameExample:Oregon 1000000 2Benton 53000 100000 250000 1 CorvallisLane 80000 50000 150000 2 Eugene SpringfieldSouth_Carolina 1000000 2Anderson 80000 100000 80000 2 Anderson PendletonPickens 50000 50000 20000 2 Clemson PickensYour program must define the following functions, with the exact prototypes:bool is_valid_arguments(char info[]);state create_states(int);void get_state_data(state );county create_counties(int);void get_county_data(county );void delete_info(state );In addition to these functions above, you need to determine the other functions you willneed to print information answering the following information: the state with the largest population, the county with the largest population, the counties with an income above a specific amount, (You must get input fromthe user for this!!!) the average household cost for all counties in each state, the states in sorted order by name, the states in sorted order by population, the counties within states sorted by population, the counties within states sorted by name.You need to separate your files into interface and implementation and create a Makefileto handle the compilation. Create a state_facts.h, which has the struct type for statesand counties, as well as the function declarations for your program. Now, separate yourfunction definitions into a state_facts.cpp file and your main function into arun_facts.cpp file. Now, create a makefile that will create a state_facts executablegame and clean your files.Your program must be able to: Print a usage message to the user when too few arguments are supplied orwhen the options are not –s or -f. You do not need to recover from this, justhandle by printing a message. Print an error message and recover, when the user doesn’t supply positive,non-zero integer for the states value. Print an error message and recover, when the player doesn’t supply a validfilename to open. Provide the stats for the states. Continue to ask for new states and new filename.

A generic class is a general version of a class; itis a homogenous data structure that handles multiple data types. MyArray will be similar to C++arrays but will not be constrained to a fixed size. The array size will grow dynamically when the userinserts an element to a full array. The class should not use vectors. Instead, you should usedynamic memory allocation (a dynamic array).The class should use three member variables:- myarray: the dynamic array- size: the current size of the array- used: the number of elements currently used in the arrayThe class should have the following functionalities:? A default constructor that initializes the size of the array to 5.? A default destructor that frees the dynamic memory that was allocated.? int length( ) a method that returns an integer value indicating the number of elementscurrently used in the array.? void insertHead(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the first element in thearray. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace theexisting array.? void insertTail(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the last element in thearray. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace theexisting array.? void deleteHead( ) deletes the first element in the array.? void deleteTail( ) deletes the last element in the array.? void sortAscending( ) sorts the elements of the array in ascending order. Use bubbleSort todo that.? void sortDescending( ) sorts the elements of the array in descending order. UseinsertionSort to do that.? C++ allows the overloading of the [ ] operator. This feature makes it possible to accessan element in a MyArray object in an array-like behavior. Overload this operator andmake sure to have boundary checks using assertions. If the user tries to access anelement outside the range of the array or at a location that is not used yet then an errormessage should be displayed on the screen.For example, the following code:P a g e | 2MyArray a1;cout &lt;&lt; “Number of elements in a1= “ &lt;&lt; a1.length() &lt;&lt; endl;a1.insertTail(35);a1.insertTail(45);a1.insertHead(55);a1.deleteTail();for(int i =0; i &lt; a1.length(); i++)cout &lt;&lt; a1[i] &lt;&lt; endl;Will result in:Number of elements in a1= 05535If we try any of the two instructions the result should be an assertion error:cout &lt;&lt; a1[4]; //Subscript uninitialized.cout &lt;&lt; a1[14]; //Subscript out of range.Write a main( ) method that provides a menu driven interface that allows the user to test whethereach member function of myArray is working properly. The menu should provide the followingfunctionalities:o Create a new array: allows the user to create an array of one of the following types: bool, char,double, float, int, stringo Get Length: the current number of elements used in the arrayo Insert a new element at the head of the arrayo Insert a new element at the tail of the arrayo Delete the first elemento Delete the last elemento Sort the elements in ascending ordero Sort the elements in descending ordero Print all the elements in the arrayo Quit the programWhat to hand inPlease submit your C++ source file electronically through Angel.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C++","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"}]},{"title":"C++代写：ECE 275 ­ Project 3","slug":"page28","date":"2016-11-04T21:24:54.000Z","updated":"2017-01-03T09:22:46.548Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/05/page28/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/05/page28/","excerpt":"","text":"Introductionc++模拟一个汽车运动模型，文件输入运行轨迹，车辆情况等等。根据一些数学和物理的公式，计算最后的汽车运动情况，同时考虑到c++的类的设计，要求类设计完好。control类，driver类，read类，write类等等功能分离使得思路更加清晰代码明了RequirementUsageUsage: catcar controlInputs stateOutputsRequirements SummaryCreate a C++ program that reads control inputs for a self­driving car from an input file. The program will simulate the car’sstate over the time horizon given by the control inputs, and write the results to an output file. The major problem is: the inputfile was written in such a way that the control inputs are stored out of order!Assignment NameThe assignment name for this assignment is: ​catcar1. Kinematic Model SimulationIn this project, you will create a program that controls an autonomous vehicle from an input control file. The only problem isthat the input controls are jumbled, since a function that operated on the linked list that stored them was badly designed: theywere stored in order in a queue, but the queue was designed by a Visual Basic programmer who doesn’t understand memory.They printed the nodes out by order of memory address of the list nodes, instead of by the node order prescribed by the nextpointers.So you need to put them back in the right order before proceeding. This program will read in time value at which thiscommand should be executed, then the commanded speed, and tire angle. The duration of the command is the differencebetween this command’s time value, and the next time value (when the nodes are in order), at a maximum of 201 ms. If thereare any durations longer than 201 ms, the input file should be declared invalid, and no simulation should take place.With this sequence of commands, you should save the vehicle’s state at each time step. During the execution of controlcommands, this program will record the vehicle’s state as it moves (or stands still), and save the output states to a file.2. File Format2.1 controlInputsFor this assignment, the input text file will consist of control information, each line contains sample time (in seconds),commanded vehicle velocity (m/s), and tire angle rate (radians/s), with elements separated by whitespace (even the firstnumber could be padded by a whitespace in the front). All values should be stored as doubles.0.06 5 0.5230.02 20 ­0.5230.07 8 00.00 0 0In this example, at time 0.06 the vehicle should take in as its input command a velocity of 5, with a tire­angle rate of 0.523,for 0.01 seconds. The duration of 0.01 is determined by looking at the next time step (after the vector is confirmed to besorted), and taking the difference (0.07 ­ 0.06).Clearly the above example is an extreme case of driving aggressively. Your program should run regardless of the unlikelycontrol inputs, as long as the below conditions are met:­ The rst element of the sorted list must be at exactly time 0.­ Commanded tire angle rate must be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e., / 6 radians/sec). ±π­ Commanded velocity must be between [0, 30] m/s;­ Time values must be non­negative; and­ Duration between sorted input objects must be between [5, 201] ms.If any of these are violated for any input value in the file, then the ​controlInputs file is deemed invalid, and an emptyoutput file is written. If at any time a line fails to parse, then the file should be declared invalid. This policy is for safety: youwouldn’t want to start controlling an autonomous car if you accidentally passed in the wrong file, and it started somehowparsing lines!2.2 outputFileThis assignment should output a file with information on the state values of the vehicle throughout its journey. The format forthis file is one called csv (comma separated values), and is common for inputting data into MATLAB. Each output entry is asfollows:t,x1,x2,x3,x4\\nWhere t is the time at which this state value was measured, and the values in x are given by the kinematic equation (1). Theprecision for each value should be whatever is the default when using C++ iostream methods.If the control inputs are determined to be invalid, you should create an empty file with the name provided from the commandline.3. Vehicle ModelYou are developing a vehicle simulator, which describes the kinematic motion of a front­steered, two­wheel drive vehicle.The vehicle you are simulating is visually depicted below. The equations of motion for this vehicle are provided in (1).x​1 ​ = ​u​1 ​ cos(​x​3​ ) cos(​x​4​ )(1)x​2 ​ = ​u​1 ​ cos(​x​3​ ) sin(​x​4​ )x​3 ​ = ​u​2x​4 ​ = ​u​1 ​ (1/L) sin(​x​3​ )Where ​x​1 is translational forward motion, ​x​2 is translational left/right motion, x​3 is the tire angle, and ​x​4 is the heading of thevehicle. For control inputs, ​u​1 represents vehicle velocity, and ​u​2 represents angular rate of change for the tire angle. Thewheelbase L is defined in the Vehicle.h header file.Using a simple discretization of these differential equations with a duration ​t​, we can use the following equations for motion:x​1​ (​t​+∆​ t​ )​ ​ = ​x​1​ (​t​) + ∆​ t​ ​u​1​ (​t​)​ ​ cos(​x​3​ (​t​)) cos(​x​4​ (​t​)) (2)x​2 ​ (​t​+∆​ t​ ) = ​x​2 ​ (​t​) +​​∆​ t​ ​u​1​ (​t​)​ ​ cos(​x​3​ (​t​)) sin(​x​4​ (​t​))x​3 ​ (​t​+∆​ t​ )​ ​ = ​x​3 ​ (​t​) + ​​∆​ t ​ u​2​ (​t​)x​4 ​ (​t​+∆​ t​ ) = ​x​4 ​ (​t​) + ​​∆​ t ​ u​1 ​ (​t​) (1/L) sin(​x​3​ (​t​))The value for ​x​3 (tire angle) must always be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e.,/ 6 radians/sec). If a value is ±πcommanded outside this range, then ​x​3 should saturate using the above range. Ex: If the tire angle rate is commanded to bethe value 0.7156, the tire angle rate should equal the maximum value of 0.5236.The heading should always be between [0, 2 ). If the heading is a negative value, the heading should be converted into the πrange [0, 2 ) by repeatedly adding 2 . Ex: If the heading is ­.5 , the heading can be converted to ­0.5 +2 = 1.5 . π π π π π πDefined values are present for these ranges inside of ​State.h4. Class designsThe following class definitions must be used for the indicated classes. You may (if you wish) create your own classes to doother tasks. The below classes are prescribed in whole (or in part):Input​, ​State​, ​Vehicle​ (must use exact prescribed class definitions)DataSource​, ​DataSink​, ​Director​ (are at your discretion, except for the sort method prescribed).4.1 Classes that must use prescribed definitionsPlease use the exact interfaces for Vehicle, State, and Input, or your alpha release may not compile. These are the only classesfor which the design is fixed.4.1.1 InputThe ​Input class holds the values for the u variables used in the kinematic model. Its interface is included on Piazza as aresource for this Project.4.1.2 StateThe ​State class is similar to Input, and its interface is included on Piazza as a resource for this Project. However, it doesensure that tire angle values and heading values stay within the designated ranges if the setters for the class are called.4.2 VehicleThe ​Vehicle class executes a control input for the designated duration. The interface is included on Piazza as a resource forthis Project.The ​Vehicle keeps its own state, receives a control input, and updates its state. The initial state value for the ​Vehicle isx​1 = 0, x​2​=0, ​x​3 = 0, and ​x​4 = 0, e.g., (0, 0) position, tire angle of 0, and heading of 0. The ​Vehicle class assumes that anyinvalid input values have been removed, so it does not do any error checking. The class does not permit anyone to update itsstate, except by providing an ​Input​ object through the ​stateUpdate​ method prescribed in the header file.4.3 Classes left largely to your design discretionAnything you want to add to the interface for ​DataSource​, ​DataSink​, or ​Director​ is up to you.The ​DataSource class keeps a vector of ​Input objects (control inputs), in order. Likewise, the ​DataSink class keeps avector of ​State​ objects (state outputs), in order.The ​Director​ is used to pass ​Input​ values along to the ​Vehicle​.Hint​: The ​bool data type is defined in C++, so it won’t work if you try to include the headers from previous projects. Use,instead, the builtin type from C++ for bool functionality.5. Recommended Functional DecompositionIn C++, global functions are a sign of a bad design. Rather, you provide methods inside the scope of a class. If you use globalfunctions for this assignment, you will receive significant design deductions. Just like in C programs, your main functionshould be small. If yours includes lots of logic, rather than depending on the methods of classes, you will receive significantdesign deductions.5.1 Reading Control InputsDefine a class method (not a global function) that reads all the control inputs from a provided filename. As you read them in,don’t worry about how they’re sorted. The inputs will be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which classthis should be.5.2 Sorting Control InputsPuts the control inputs in order of their timestamp. The interface for the sort function should be:void​ sort (); ​// performs qsortIf your algorithm does not perform quicksort, you will receive a deduction. Insertion and bubble sort are each unacceptable.You should write your own sort routine, not use the sort routines in STL or any other library. You are, of course, welcome touse other implementations to confirm that your qsort implementation is working, as part of your own tests. The inputs will bealready be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which class this should be.5.2.1 Validating Control InputsThis method should be part of the ​DataSource​ class. The interface for this method should be:// should be called only after the vector is sorted// returns true if the vector in Input objects is validbool ​validate ();The vector of ​Input​ objects is invalid if any of the criteria from Section 2.1 are discovered.5.3 Writing State OutputsDefine a class method (not a global function) that writes a vector of ​Output objects to a file of the provided filename. Ithink you can figure out which class this should be.5.4 Driving the CarOnce you have an (ordered) set of control inputs, you need a ​Director to coordinate the consumption of inputs, and saveeach output. The ​Director will take the next Input (stored and sorted by the ​DataSource​) to the vehicle, fetch thatOutput​, and store it in the output vector in the ​DataSink​. When the last ​Input is consumed, a duration of 200 ms shouldbe used. After simulating this ​Input​, the simulation is ended. In order to do this, the ​Director will “contain” a ​Vehicleobject, and decide how to interact with it.Part of the assignment is coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in order to stage your design.5.5 What goes in main, then?In your main function, you should instantiate your classes, check your arguments and return the usage statement. Put all thelogic and error handling for file I/O, initialization of the ​Vehicle​, etc., in your methods as defined in your other files and inthe order that makes sense. You want your main to be very simple, so that if you want to reuse your code, you can do sowithout a main function.Generally, part of assignments going forward include coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in orderthat your design can be performed in stages. To bootstrap this process, we provide as an example how to sketch an algorithmis pseudocode below:check usageopen input file, and output fileexecute director while inputs execute input(s) save output(s)write and close output file, input file6. Alpha SubmissionYour alpha assignment is to implement the Vehicle class methods, and turn in your ​Vehicle.cpp file to the dropbox calledProject 3 (alpha) on D2L. We will use your file with our own main function and test files, to check the behavior of each ofthe ​Vehicle methods we prescribe. Use the same ​vehicle.h ​file given above and provided from the website, or be indanger of your alpha not compiling.As a note, you will have to complete your implementation of ​Input and ​State in order to test your alpha on your own.Submit only your ​Vehicle.cpp ­­ ​do not submit implementations for Input and Output​, we will use our own. We havealready included ​Input.h and ​State.h in our ​vehicle.h interface definition, but you may need to include otherheaders for standard C++ functionality in your cpp file. We do not recommend including headers for other custom classes inyour cpp file, since you will not be submitting those headers or their implementation.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C++","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"C++代写：FinalProject-SuperString.v3","slug":"page27","date":"2016-11-04T10:34:24.000Z","updated":"2017-01-03T09:19:06.729Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/04/page27/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/04/page27/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction自己实现一个类似stl的string库的superstring，对string功能进行扩展，包括自己实现 ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.等操作符的重载，构造函数，find函数，trim函数，insert，replace，还有类型转换等等函数的实现，难度不大，但是工作量很大。RequirementSET-252 C Programming #2Homework: SuperString – Final Project ( 30% of your final grade )Warning: You fail the course if you fail the final project.Warning: Your final grade for the course cannot be higher than your final project grade.Warning: You cannot consult with any student that has already completed this project.Warning: You cannot view, use or reference any code for this project written by students that have taken this course in the past.Step 1Implement the following class header file (i.e. write the cpp file).You may add any other properties and/or methods that you need.

For this lab you will NOT be creating any classes of your own. In fact you can do the whole lab in the main, although I think that you will see that it is highly advisable to have at least one non-member function since there is a task that is repeated.Begin by copying the file names.txt to your working directory. This file has a long list of first names, all taken from some of my classes. Briefly open it and look at it, or just skim through it with more names.txtAt the top of your program #includeas well as iostream, string, and fstream. Declare a multiset that is capable of holding strings.Fill the multiset with all the names in the file. (Since there are no spaces in the names you can use &gt;&gt; or getline.)Now declare an iterator that is appropriate for traversing the multiset. Set it to the beginning of the multiset full of names, and walk through the list, outputting each name it finds. (There are a lot of them, so you may want to separate them with spaces instead of putting one on each line.)Run and test this program. Your name should be somewhere in the list. (Note that the names are now in alphabetical order.)Here is the place where you want to pass your STL container to a non-member function, since we are doing something that is basically the same three times in a row. If you do you should pass the container by const and reference, since it is large. You will probably want one additional parameter.Declare two iterators.Move one of them through the list to the first name that begins with ‘M’. Since you know it is returning a string, you will know that (it).at(0) will return the first character in that string.Now set the second iterator equal to the first. Use it to count how many M names there are in the list. Print this number out.Using the second iterator, print out all the M names in reverse alphabetical order. (Remember that these are bidirectional iterators, so you –it works to go backwards.)Now do the above three steps for all the ‘C’ names and then for all the ‘Q’ names.If I had asked for ‘Y’ (I didn’t) the output would look like:There are 3 Y names in the listThey are:Yujia Yuanhang YingjieThis program has no user interaction.

This game is played on a graph of movies and actors/actresses who starred in them. The Bacon Number is defined as follows: Kevin Bacon has a Bacon Number of 0; people who co-starred in a movie with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon Number of 1; people who co-starred in a movie with someone who has a Bacon Number of 1 in turn have a Bacon Number of 2; and so on. Given any actor/actress, the goal of the game is to establish their Bacon Number by a sequence of movies and co-stars. As shown in Figure 1, Bill Murray has a Kevin Bacon number of 1, because co-starred in “Wild Things”, while Cameron Diaz has a Kevin Bacon Number of 2, because she she co-starred with Bill Murray in “Charlie’s Angels”.For example, using the “action” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Numberof 3 as follows:Pacino, Al Heat (1995)Rosales Jr., Thomas Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)Richards, Ariana Tremors (1990)Bacon, KevinKevin Bacon (0) starred in Tremors with Richards, Ariana (1) who starred in Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997) with Rosales Jr., Thomas (2) who starred in Heat (1995) with Pacino, Al (3). If we use the “all cast” data set given below, we can show that “Al Pacino” has a Bacon Number of 1 as follows:Pacino, Al Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006)Bacon, KevinKevin Bacon (0) starred in Boffo! Tinseltown’s Bombs and Blockbusters (2006) with Pacino, Al (1). Inter- estingly this works way in the past as well:De Rosselli, Rex Lion’s Claws, The (1918)Brinley, Charles Adventure in Sahara (1938)Lawrence, Marc (I) Big Easy, The (1987)Goodman, John (I) Death Sentence (2007)Bacon, KevinTurns out that Rex De Rosselli died in 1941 and yet he has a Bacon Number of just 4. Actually Rex really has a Bacon Number of 3 but we need to use a much bigger data set “cast.all.txt” to show this:De Rosselli, Rex Dangerous Adventure, A (1922)McCullough, Philo Chamber of Horrors (1966)Danova, Cesare Animal House (1978)Bacon, KevinWe have included two data sets suitable for the program in the archive above (the data sets are courtesy of Robert Sedgewick):action06.txt (4.4 MB, only action movies)cast.all.txt (64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB)The format of these data sets is rather simple: Each line is a movie, and each movie consists of several fields separated by the “/“ character. The first field is the name of the movie itself, all the following fields are the names of actors and actresses starring in the movie. For example:Heat (1995)/Daniels, Max/Perry, Manny/Marzan, Rick/Pacino, Al, …Heat After Dark (1996)/Kitami, Toshiyuki/Sugata,…Heated Vengeance (1985)/Dye, Cameron/Walker, Robert (III), …Reading this data is not complicated, but we hand you the parsing code anyway so you can focus on the search algorithm instead.In order to find the smallest Bacon Number for an actor we proceed as follows: First we identify the vertices for both Kevin Bacon and the actor in question (you already have that code). Then we start a breadth-first search at the vertex for Kevin Bacon; as we do this we keep track of the “previous vertex” that got us to the one we’re currently investigating. Once we find the vertex for the other actor, we are done: We just have to print out the path that got us here. This implementation of BFS is the only thing you have to write for this problem!You will implement following functions in the given project:1.Degree of separation from Kevin Bacon:2.Degree of separation between any two actors/actresses:3.Search actor/actress/movie:4.List cast of a movie or movies of an actor/actress:5.ExitSelect:Here is what each menu item does:Finds the Kevin Bacon number of an actor/actressFind the shortest distance between any two actors/actresses.Actors with same name has a Roman number after their names. You can enter the name and search the exact name in the database. For example, Emma Watson’s name appeared as “Watson, Emma (II)” in the movie database.If input is a movies, it lists all the case. If the input is an actor/actress, it lists all the movies he/shestarred in.terminate the program.The “Graph” class, “Bag” class are fully implemented for you. The Graph class represents an undirected graph of vertices named 0 through V - 1. It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph, iterate over all of the vertices adjacent to a vertex. It also provides methods for returning the number of vertices V and the number of edges E. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted. This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which is a vertex-indexed array of Bag objects. All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except iterating over the vertices adjacent to a given vertex, which takes time proportional to the number of such vertices.You will have add the mapping relationships between vertex symbols (name of a movie, actor, acres) and vertex number in “SymbolGraph” class. For example: in Graph 2, vertex 0 and vertex 5 can represent movies and other vertices represent actors/actresses. You also have to implement to methods to find the shortest path between two given vertices. All edges have the weight of 1. Therefore, you can also use BFS to find the shortest distance between two vertices.Before you are sure your program is running correctly, test your code with a smaller database base. Start with a file that only has 5-10 movies and actors/actresses. If you think your program is working, then try with “action06.txt”, (4.4 MB, only action movies). To try “cast.all.txt”, 64 MB, all movies from the 2014 IMDB, 300,000 movies, 900,000 actors/actresses, you have to allocate larger memory for your project. Google it for instructions to do that. If you run your program from coo and line you specify memory size in your command line. Following command allocate 2gb memory for JVM to run KevinBacon.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"Python代写：CP164 Stacks","slug":"page23","date":"2016-10-30T01:32:24.000Z","updated":"2016-11-03T08:16:13.928Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/30/page23/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/30/page23/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction这次需要代写的是一个关于Stack的Lab作业，由于是Lab作业，工作量并不大，都是基本的Stack操作。Requirementsing Versus Extending an ADTNote: In this and future labs we make a distinction between using an ADT and extending an ADT. You must be clear on this distinction:Using an ADTWhen asked to use an ADT write a program that is implementation independent, i.e. the program uses only ADT methods (such as those for a stack) and works for either the array or linked implementation of a data structure. Do not change any code in the ADT implementation files such as stack_array.py.Extending an ADTWhen asked to extend an ADT you are going to add new methods to an ADT, meaning that you are going to add code to one or both of the array or linked implementation of a data structure, such as stack_array.py.The Stack ADT (Abstract Data Type)A stack is a data structure that follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) rules. Data is added to the top of a stack and removed from the top of a stack. The Stack ADT provides methods for manipulating data in a stack.A reminder of some important points of ADT use are:No matter what the underlying implementation of the stack programs should access a stack only through these methods.As a corollary to the first point, the stack can be implemented in any number of ways so long as any given implementation follows the ADT function requirements. The implementation must invisible to the program using the Stack ADT.A stack may store any type of data, although all the data it stores should be of the same type.The following code imports a stack class and the Food class then initializes a stack:12345from stack_array import Stackfrom food import Foods = Stack() …The line:1from stack_array import Stackimports the Stack class from the library file stack_array.py. This library file can be replaced by any other file that implements the Stack ADT methods.The line:1from food import Foodgives access to the methods in the food.py library file as above.The line:1s = Stack()creates a stack named s. The stack is now ready to accept data.Project ReferencesAs we work through the term we will be creating a number of different data structures and adding more functionality to the Food library already written. Making sure that each new project has the latest version of a data structure or Food library is difficult to do if we are reduced to copying and pasting our pydev modules into each new project. Fortunately, Eclipse provides a much better mechanism to reference code. Setting up Project References allows you to link one Pydev project to another, and to use the code from one project in another with the import and from … import * statements already shown. Nothing needs to be changed in your source code.To make a reference from one project to another in Eclipse, right click on a project name in the Navigator pane. From the resulting pop-up menu click on Properties and then on Project References in the resulting dialog box.Click on the check box of all projects that you wish to reference from the current project. In this example the project album is already selected, and the project data_structures will be added as a reference. Once this is done all of the classes in both album and data_structures will be available through import statements.A few things to keep in mind when using project references:All referenced projects must be open when attempting to run a program.Submit all referenced projects as part of your Eclipse archive (.zip) file when submitting exercises or the markers will not be able to run your programs. You may select multiple projects to include in an Eclipse archive file.Do not use the same Pydev module names in two different referenced projects or Eclipse will not know which one an import statement is supposed to be referring to.Project references go one way only. If the project stacks references the project data_structures, then data_structures should not reference stacks. Circular references are a very bad idea.Upon occasion referenced projects may become ‘out of sync’ with the project that references them. To fix this, right-click on the project and choose Refresh to update Eclipse from the file system.Array-based StacksThe file stack_array.py is a text file containing the basic outline of the array-based Stack class. Copy this code into the Pydev module stack_array.py in your login_data_structures project (where login is your Network login). Thus, a student with the Network login barn4520 should name their projects barn4520_Food and barn4520_data_structures.) The Lab Instructor will walk you through this library and discuss its inner workings.Tasks(If you were unable to complete Lab 1 correctly, you may use these files: food.py, food_utilities.py, and foods.txt as the basis for your lab. These files will not be available until after the labs for the previous week are completed.)For the appropriate tasks you may download and use the Food class definition in food.py from Lab 1.For all of your data structures (stacks, queues, BSTs, etc.), put your code into libraries in your Pydev project login_data_structures.For the stack_array library complete the implementations of the is_empty, pop, and peek methods. These methods extend the Stack ADT.Write and test the following function:12345678910111213def array_to_stack(s, a): “”” ——————————————————- Pushes contents of a onto s. Use: array_to_stack(s, a) ——————————————————- Preconditions: s - a Stack object (Stack) a - a Python list (list) Postconditions: The contents of a are moved into s, a is empty. ——————————————————- “””Add this function to a Pydev module named utilities in your login_data_structures project so that you have easy access to it later.Write and test the following function:12345678910111213def stack_to_array(s, a): “”” ——————————————————- Pops contents of s into a.

Send the file as a single attachment through Blackboard. The subject of this email is YourLastName_FirstName_project.NoteWrite your name as a comment line at the very beginning of each .java program: 1 point deducted for each file without your name at top.Besides this documentation, I also provide you a text file, accounts.txt (described below). You should download this text file into the directory of your Netbeans project for your programs. Make sure when accessing this text file programmatically, your program just uses the file name without explicitly providing a path (so called relative path). For instance,1File accountFile = new File(“accounts.txt”);For more information about the absolute path, refer to chapter 18 lecture slides. Failing to use the relative path loses 4 points.SuggestionsStart early and start from simple – this is VERY important. For example, begin from the week when the project is available. As the first step, you construct the GUI but not implement functions for button clicks.For the give function buttons, you may start to implement the Exit function first, and then the functions of Deposit and Withdraw buttons.Always keep a copy of your working code before you implement more requirements.Requirements in summary1) Develop a Java GUI application that reads account information from the provided text file (accounts.txt), shows all account numbers in a JComboBox, and displays other GUI controls as shown in Fig. 1;2) Exit button : Quit the application;3) Deposit button: Make a deposit to a selected account;4) Withdraw button: Make a withdrawal from a selected account;5) Transfer To button: Make a transfer from a selected account to a beneficiary account;Requirements in detailsGUI in generalOnce the program starts, it reads all account information from accounts.txt (each row in the file is a account record and is in the format ofaccountNumber&lt;&gt;openDate&lt;&gt;customerName&lt;&gt;balanceThe openDate is in the format of year/month/day.) It then fills a JComboBox with all account numbers and shows other GUI controls as in Fig. 1. Your program must be able to “read” the file of this format programmatically because when I test your project, the file content (not the format) will be changed.When you select an item (account number) from the JComboBox, the corresponding values for openDate, customerName, and balance will be shown in the three read-only text fields, and the Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer To buttons become enabled, see Fig. 2.ExitClicking this button to close the frame and exit the program.Instead of using mouse to click the button, pressing Alt + x will also trigger the Exit button.Deposit(After selecting an account number from the JComboBox), clicking the Deposit button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 3 asking you to enter a deposit amount for the selected account. Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane.showInputDialog().If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, the amount will be deposited to the account. See Fig 4 - the balanced is adjusted accordingly. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 3, nothing will happen to this account.If an invalid deposit amount is entered in Fig. 3, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 5.Hint: this dialog window is generated by JOptionPane. showConfirmDialog().Withdraw(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Withdraw button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 6 asking you to enter a withdrawal amount for the selected account.If you enter a non-negative number, such as 100, and if the account balance is sufficient, the withdrawal will be made from the account successfully. See Fig. 7, the balanced is adjusted. The accounts.txt file should also be updated accordingly as well.If you clicking Cancel in Fig. 6, nothing will occur to this account.If an invalid withdrawal amount is entered in Fig. 6, such as -100 or $100, you will see an error message as shown in Fig 8.If a withdrawal amount is greater than the balance, you show an error message and stop the withdrawal.Transfer To(After selecting an account from the JComboBox), clicking the Transfer To button will popup a window as shown in Fig. 10 asking you to enter a beneficiary account number.If a valid account number (any number existing in the JComboBox) is entered, after click OK button, a window like Fig. 11 pops up asking for amount to transfer.If a valid amount is entered, and the balance is not less than this amount and sometimes the sum of this transfer amount and a transfer fee, the transfer will be succeeded as shown in Fig. 12 and 13. The transfer fee is only applied to account with the balance less than $10000 which is specified in AccountConstants interface (more about AccountConstants see end of this document).If an invalid beneficiary account number (i.e., a number which does not exist in the account number JComboBox) is entered in Fig. 10, Fig. 14 shows the error message.If the balance is not sufficient for the transfer amount, Fig. 15 shows the error message.If the balance is not sufficient to cover both transfer amount and transfer fee (when such a fee applies), Fig. 16 shows the error message.Design requirementsYou must have the following five classes (at least 5 points deduction for missing a required class).AccountConstants – contains two constants, CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD (value is 10000) and TRANSFER_FEE (value is 2.0). For this project, the business rule is as follows:When making a transfer to a beneficiary account, if the balance of the transferring account is less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is deducted from the balance after the transfer is made. If the balance is not sufficient to cover both CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD and TRANSFER_FEE (if the fee applies), the transfer should not be made. If the balance of transferring account is not less than CHECKING_BALANCE_THRESHOLD, TRANSFER_FEE is waived for this transfer.Account – transferTo() method is abstract. deposit() and withdraw() are not abstract. If you need, feel free to define other methods, such as getBalance(), in the Account class.CheckingAccount: extends Account and implements the transferTo method (refer to the above diagram). The returned value of transferTo method is defined as follows.return 0: transfer successful and without transfer feereturn 1: transfer successful and with the transfer fee appliedreturn -1: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amount and transfer feereturn -2: transfer unsuccessful because balance is less than transfer amountAccountUtility – reads accounts.txt file, updates the file, and provides data for other programs.AccountApp – is the only Java program having the main method. This must be the only file with a main method. If not, you lose 5 points.Depending on your design and it’s your decision that you may have more Java programs than those specified above.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"C代写：CS158 Find The Digits","slug":"page20","date":"2016-10-26T14:46:54.000Z","updated":"2016-11-03T08:07:20.930Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/26/page20/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/26/page20/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction代写一个C语言的小作业，寻找一个数学问题的解RequirementGiven a positive integer (greater than zero) and a positive digit (1 - 9) find the smallest multiple of the positive integer that is composed only of digits less than or equal to the digit specified by the user.Example Execution #1:Enter a positive integer: 7Enter largest permissible digit: 3Smallest multiple of 7 containing digits less than or equal to 3 is: 21Example Execution #2:Enter a positive integer: 88Enter largest permissible digit: 5Smallest multiple of 88 containing digits less than or equal to 5 is: 352Example Execution #3:Enter a positive integer: 15Enter largest permissible digit: 2Smallest multiple of 15 containing digits less than or equal to 2 is: 120Example Execution #4:Enter a positive integer: 12Enter largest permissible digit: 1Smallest multiple of 12 containing digits less than or equal to 1 is: 11100Example Execution #5:Enter a positive integer: 34Enter largest permissible digit: 4Smallest multiple of 34 containing digits less than or equal to 4 is: 34Example Execution #6:Enter a positive integer: 789Enter largest permissible digit: 2Smallest multiple of 789 containing digits less than or equal to 2 is: 11202222Additional RequirementsAdd the homework assignment header file to the top of your program. A description of your program will need to be included in the assignment header. This particular header can be added to your file by entering hhw while in command mode in vi.Each example execution represents a single test of your program. The six examples provided imply that the program was run six different times.Your program is expected to accept input and produce output in the same manner demonstrated above.The user will always enter a positive integer followed by a single digit in the range from 1 to 9.Each test case will result in finding a multiple that is less than or equal to INT_MAX as found in the limits.h library.Do not add any “bonus” features not demonstrated in the example executions provided.Course standards prohibit the use of programming concepts not yet introduced in lecture. For this assignment you can consider all material in the first six chapters of the book, notes, and lectures to be acceptable for use.The use of arrays will result in no credit being awarded for your effort.For this assignment you will be required to implement the user-defined functions (from chapter 4). Failing to follow course standards as they relate to good user-defined function use will result in a zero for this assignment.A program MUST compile to be considered for partial credit. The submission script will reject the submission of any file that does not successfully compile on the guru server. The name of the source code file you attempt to submit must be hw05.c, no variation is permitted.Course Programming and Documentation Standards RemindersUse the course function header (head_fx vi shortcut hfx while in command mode) for every user-defined function in your program.List and comment all parameters to a function, one per line, in the course function header.All function declarations will appear in the global declaration section of your program.The user-defined function definitions will appear in your program after the main function.Indent all code within relevant selection and repetition constructs two additional spaces.Make use of { and } with all relevant selection and repetition constructs.Place a single space between all operators and operands. Comment all variables to the right of each declaration. Declare only one variable per line.Notice that several programs (see program 2-9 on pages 74-75) in the programming text use a single line comment to indicate the start of the local declaration and executable statement sections of the main function.At no point during the semester should these two sections ever overlap. You might consider adopting this habit of commenting the start of each section to help you avoid this mistake.Select meaningful identifiers (names) for all variables and functions in your program.Indent all code found within the main and all user-defined functions exactly two spaces.Control-forcing statements such as exit, break, continue, and the use of multiple return statements in a single function are not acceptable practices according to course standards.Do not single (or double) space the entire program, use blank lines when appropriate.Consider making symbolic/defined constants to represent those values that do not change during the execution of the program.There is no need to include example output with your submission.Remove any diagnostic print statements from your code, even if they are commented out (inactive), unless you believe your program to be logically incorrect or incomplete as a way to demonstrate to your lab instructor how much of the problem you were able to solve and attempted to implement.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"}]},{"title":"Python代写：CME3036 June Jolly","slug":"page19","date":"2016-10-25T14:36:14.000Z","updated":"2016-11-03T08:06:05.421Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/25/page19/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/25/page19/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction这次需要代写的作业比较有意思，根据提供的历史数据中，各场比赛的得分情况，来预测本次球赛的每个球队的胜率。类似世界杯赛场的大数据预测，不过作业的模型和公式要简单许多。最终冠军和初始分组有关，事实上并没有一支球队能够稳拿冠军，每次模拟的结果都不同。程序语言不限，甚至允许用Objective-C, Perl以及Ruby来写。选择用Python因为编写和调试方便。RequirementFThe National Funball League (NFL) runs a series of funball games each year. This time period is colloquially known as funball season. The goal of funball is to score the most points. Many cities have their own funball teams and compete in the NFL. Despite the name, funball is very serious and the games are extremely competitive.In June after the regular season, the NFL hosts a single-elimination tournament to determine the best funball team. Win or go home! The winner gets a year’s worth of bragging rights and claim to a rotating trophy.In an attempt to make the tournament as exciting as possible, the NFL pairs stronger teams with weaker teams in the early rounds expecting that only the best teams will be left at the end of the tournament. The process of ranking teams is called seeding. Lower seed values indicate stronger teams.For logistical reasons, the tournament is broken into 4 regions: N, S, E, and W.The tournament is so popular that several derived games have appeared. Among the most popular is a pick’em challenge where players attempt to pick all of the winners in the tournament before any tournament games are played. In recent years, the pick’em challenge has been hosted by Sanguine Bank which offered a million dollar prize to anyone who could pick all of the correct teams.QuestionsLet p(A) be the winning percentage of team A and p B be the winning percentage of team B. Assume we use the formula 1 to estimate the probability that A wins in a matchup against B.P(A wins|A and B play) = p(A)(1 - p(B)) / p(A)(1 - p(B)) + (1 - p(A))p(B)Using this formula, which year’s tournament results had the highest probability?To answer this question, please use the attached data.regular season results.csvseasons.csvteams.csvtourney results.csvtourney seeds.csvtourney slots.csvSanguine Bank has decided that the payout of the pick’em challenge is too risky. They contacted Auspicious Insurance Group (AIG) for a quote on a special insurance contract that covers the payout from the challenge. How much should AIG charge Sanguine Bank for the insurancecontract? It is sufficient to explain your approach; no code or amounts are required for this question.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Python/"}]},{"title":"C++代写 FIT2049 Simple Game Implementation","slug":"page18","date":"2016-10-24T05:26:34.000Z","updated":"2016-11-03T08:03:08.918Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/24/page18/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/24/page18/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction代写一个比较炫酷的3D的游戏，本质上其实还是在2D上的Grid运算，只不过GUI方面提供了3D的渲染引擎。RequirementFor your first assignment you’ll be implementing a simple colour matching game inspired by the Bejeweled series and creatively titled “Colour Match”. The game revolves around finding groups of the same colour on a 3D grid of cubes. The basic gameplay is as follows:When the game starts a grid of random colours will appear on screen.In a separate section of the screen, the player will be shown a random colour – this is known as the “Next Colour”.Using the arrow keys, the player will select one of the cubes on the grid and when they press the spacebar key, the colour of the selected cube will change to match the “Next Colour”.If the change in colour causes three or more cubes of the same colour to be “connected”, those cubes are removed from the screen and the player’s score is increased (the amount of score increase is up to you, but they should get bigger scores for matching larger amounts of cubes).After the matched cubes are removed, cubes above them on the grid should move down to fill their place (there should never be any holes in the board). New cubes should also appear along the top of the board to fill the place of any cubes which fell down to a lower row.After the cubes are removed, the “Next Colour” is randomised again and the player can pick another cube to replace.When the game ends, a game over screen should be displayed which tells the player their final score. A quit and a restart button should also be present on this screen.The end condition of the game is controlled by two things:If a move doesn’t result in a match of three or more connected cubes, a life is lost. After losing three lives, the game ends.A move counter should also be included which limits the amount of allowed moves per game. The player should be able to see the amount of moves remaining somewhere in the UI.To spice up the gameplay, a special Power Cube should be included, as outlined below:When the player selects a cube on the grid and activates the power cube with the P key, every cube on the grid that matches the selected colour should be removed from the board.The score rewarded should be based on the amount of cubes that were removed.The power cube is available from the start of the game and can only be used once - use it wisely!Defining “Connected”There are a few options for what we consider “connected” to mean. You can attempt one of the three options presented below depending on the grade you’re targeting.To receive a pass for the criterion “Are matching cubes correctly identified?”, you should look for matching colours in the immediate four neighbors. In the below images, the dark grey tile is the selected cell for the current turn, and the light grey are matching colours which should be removed.To receive a medium grade, you should look for lines of the same colour originating from the selected cell on any of its four sides.To be eligible for full marks, you should keep stepping through neighbours and find chunks of the same colour.Provided AssetsProvided inside the Assignment 1 Assets file on Moodle are all the assets you’ll need to create the game. The cubes have a width and length of one unit allowing for easier placement. It is recommended you build your solution off the Week 3 Base Code (while waiting for that code to be released, you should spend week two thinking about your solution).Please note that while additional assets may be included, they won’t be considered when marking.Only your C++ code and the quality of your gameplay will be assessed (we’re not marking your modelling skills).","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C++","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"},{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithm/"}]},{"title":"代写c++ Application Development using C++  1","slug":"page17","date":"2016-10-23T04:16:44.000Z","updated":"2016-11-01T11:55:48.713Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/23/page17/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/23/page17/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction根据题目需求完成一个名字叫PIG的小游戏，用到了c++的类的封装等操作，分为玩家与玩家和电脑与电脑这2种方法，使用到了数据结构list, 电脑玩家需要自己涉及最少2种以上的智能策略。最后需要总结分析，写一份相关的报高文档Requirement2016/17 ELEC362 - Application Development using C++ 1Assignment 1Program a multiplayer console game of ‘Pig’Game Rules: (according to Wikipedia)Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to“hold”:• If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player’s turn.• If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player’s turncontinues.• If a player chooses to “hold”, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomesthe next player’s turn.The first player to score 100 or more points wins.For example, the first player, Ann, begins a turn with a roll of 5.

The games have beenscheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s timeto prepare to sell spectator tickets.Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.Stage 1: DesignThis stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and howit is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template hasbeen provided for your use.Requirements:1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of thisprogram.2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this willoccur in Stage 3: Testing.a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if youdo not end up including all these requirements in your program code.b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure thatonly valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed ofthis and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exceptionhandling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may includeextra information if you wish.

These requirements have been broken into three groups: Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essentialcomponents of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code towork and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to useconstants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for theserequirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will notreceive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used theappropriate programming construct to do so.At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, orto modularize it straight away. Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used toensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another asparameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is notessential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see. Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirementshave been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we havenot covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until thegames commence.All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, usingnaming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.Base Functionality:1. Display a welcome message when the program starts The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just longenough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this. The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIAOLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white spacefirst. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces? A second line of the message should be blank. The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”. The fourth line should be blank.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 4 of 92. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option untilthe user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If aninvalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make anotherselection.3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the usercan select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects anoption by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised andshown the menu again to make another selection.a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter theNumber of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they arereturned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additionaltickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but apurchase of 0 tickets is permitted.b. Should the user select Finalise Order:i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchasedand the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2ticket costs $11.25.ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 ticketssold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from allorders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in eachindividual order.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 5 of 9iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.c. Should the user select Cancel Order:i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and boththe total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message.

Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order isdisplayed until the order is finalized7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods asparameters.Advanced Functionality:8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until thegames begin.a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to importjava.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time theprogram runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just updatethe date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number ofdays until the games commence.c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 7 of 9Stage 3: TestingUsing a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed inStage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has notworked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your programproperly.To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in yourActual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Toolthat is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides threeseparate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirementsthrough to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.Base Functionality:This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when theprogram starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewingticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.Standard Functionality:In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that havebeen added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality mustalso be tested.If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data betweenmethods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.Advanced Functionality:This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the gamescomments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.SubmissionYour program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into theAssignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 8 of 9Marking Criteria/RubricTaskAvailableMarksStudentMarkStage 1: Design DocumentationDevelopment of an algorithm describing how the program should function All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Logical structure 1Documented test cases to validate program All requirements from the Assessment Details section included 1 Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entriesare handled smoothly1Stage 2: Program DevelopmentA Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.1Base Functionality: Display of a welcome message when the program starts 1 Menu displayed until user chooses to exit 1 Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1and Tier 2 tickets2 View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total numberof Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold1 Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user 1Standard Functionality: Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menuuntil the order is finalised1 Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods 2Advanced Functionality: Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcomemessage3Stage 3: TestingDocumented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and theresults of this testing. Testing of base functionality1 Testing of standard functionality1 Testing of advanced functionality1Total 20CRICOS Provider No. 00103D 1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx Page 9 of 9FeedbackAssignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

DescriptionIn this assignment you’ll be doing the following:1. Read a raw text file containing movie reviews and ratings.2. Remove the punctuations and stopwords (e.g. is, and, the, etc.) from the reviews andwrite the contents to a clean review file.3. Associate a value for all words found in the clean reviews based on the average rating ofthe word.4. Using the map between the words and their associated values, rate reviews fromanother file that doesn’t have any rating already.5. Write the ratings of the reviews to an output file.2.1. Clean the dataThe raw data with the reviews and the rating will be present in a file namedrawReviewRatings.txt​. Every review is given a rating between 0 - 4 (both inclusive). Thefollowing are interpretation of the rating values:● 0 = Negative● 1 = Somewhat Negative● 2 = Neutral● 3 = Somewhat Positive● 4 = PositiveEach line of review follows the following format: Example:4 The Jungle Book is awesome!CS 368 (C++) - Fall 2016Adalbert ​Gerald​​ Soosai Rajwhere 4 is the rating and the text “The Jungle Book is awesome!” is the review.Now, your first task is to read the contents of this file and ​clean the data!The following steps needs to be performed in the same order for cleaning the data:1. Read the raw reviews from an input file. e.g. ​rawReviewRatings.txt2. Replace the hyphens in every line of text with spaces.e.g. If the review contains the word “awe-inspiring”, then it should be split into 2 wordsnamely “awe” and “inspiring”3. Split each line of text into multiple words using the space character as the delimiter.e.g. “The Jungle Book is awesome!” becomes | “The” | “Jungle” | “Book” | “is” |“awesome!” |4. Remove the punctuation marks from the words.e.g. “awesome!” becomes “awesome” and “!” becomes “”5. If there are any trailing/leading whitespaces, then remove them. Remember that thespace character (‘ ’), tab (‘\\t’), newline (‘\\n’), etc. are considered as whitespaces. For acomplete list of whitespace characters ​this​.e.g. “zootopia ” becomes “zootopia”, “hello\\t” becomes “hello”, and “world\\n” becomes“world”6. Remove the empty words. i.e. words with length == 0.7. Remove single lettered words. i.e. words with length == 1.8. Remove stopwords. e.g. is, and, the, etc. The list of stopwords can be found in the filestopwords.txt9. Write the contents of the clean data to a file named ​cleanReviewRatings.txt​.2.2.

You will be using the sklearn machine learning library to perform this study. The dataset is based on four wilderness areas in the Roosevelt National Forest, located in the Front Range of northern Colorado. Cover type data came from US Forest Service inventory information, while the cartographic variables used to predict cover type consisted of elevation, aspect, and other information derived from standard digital spatial data processed in a geographic information system (GIS).Data Set Information:The prediction of forest cover type is from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data). The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Resource Information System (RIS) data. Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data. Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types).This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2)probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value, while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value.As for primary major tree species in these areas, Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1), while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species, followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3), Douglas-fir (type 6), and cottonwood/willow (type 4).The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre, due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation, etc.) Cache la Poudre would probably be more unique than the others, due to its relatively low elevation range and species composition.Attribute Information:Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of entries along the vectors of the database.Name / Data Type / Measurement / DescriptionElevation / quantitative /meters / Elevation in metersAspect / quantitative / azimuth / Aspect in degrees azimuthSlope / quantitative / degrees / Slope in degreesHorizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest surface water featuresVertical_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Vert Dist to nearest surface water featuresHorizontal_Distance_To_Roadways / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest roadwayHillshade_9am / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 9am, summer solsticeHillshade_Noon / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at noon, summer solticeHillshade_3pm / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solsticeHorizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition pointsWilderness_Area (4 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Wilderness area designationSoil_Type (40 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Soil Type designationCover_Type (7 types) / integer / 1 to 7 / Forest Cover Type designationYour tasksPreprocessing (5 marks)Write a Python script (with the file named task_1.py), thatloads the dataset shuffles the datadeals with any missing value (if any)performs normalization of the datacreates numpy arrays train_data, validation_data and test_data which contain respectively 70%, 15% and 15% of the shuffled data.saves these preprocessed arraysWhenever applicable use the validation set to select the architecturalparameters needed to build the following classifiers;Naive Bayes (5 marks)Write a Python script (with the file named task_2.py), thatbuilds naïve Bayes classifiersevaluates the prediction errorsreports these errors with a confusing matrixDecision Trees (5 marks)Write a Python script (with the file named task_3.py), thatbuilds decision tree classifiersevaluates the classifiersNearest Neighbours (5 marks)Write a Python script (with the file named task_4.py), thatbuilds kNN classifiersevaluates the classifiersSupport Vector Machines (5 marks)Write a Python script (with the file named task_5.py), thatbuilds SVM classifiersevaluates the classifiersDeliverablesYou should submit via Blackboard a zip file containingA report in pdf format limited to 10 pages of text (be concise!)describing the design of your experimentsreporting on the performance of your classifiersa statement of completeness (concise description of what you have implemented, what works, what doesn’t).All your Python script files with proper commenting.

The details of your implementation are as follows:1.Implementation detailsa.Your executable should be called PROG4b.You will invoke PROG4 asi.PROG4 ii.Assume that is a multiple of 32iii.Assume that the number of threads is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32iv.Example invocation:PROG4 3200 162.When you execute the program, the following should happena.First, you will fill the array with strictly decreasing numbers. For example, if the array is of size 320, you can initialize it to 320, 319, 318 etc.b.You will partition the array into 32 parts. You will sort each part using BUBBLESORT so that they are in increasing order. Finally, all 32 sorted parts will be merged to obtain the final sorted array. To achieve this with K threads, you will proceed as follows:i.When you have K threads, each thread will handle 32/K parts and sort them. Now, you have 32 sorted parts of original array A.ii.You will merge the sorted parts to generate array B that will represent the sorted array A.c.You will verify that the array is actually sorted and contains the correct data. For example, in the above scenario, you should see numbers from 1..320.3.Important observations:a.You are partitioning the array into 32 parts independent of the number of threads you have. This is critical. This ensures that the actual work done is independent of the number of threads.b.Normally, when you use multiple threads, this can increase the total work done. But we are trying to avoid the problemc.We initialize the array to be in a decreasing order and use bubblesort to get it into increasing order.d.The number 32 is chosen because cse410.cse.msu.edu has 32 processors.4.As an illustration of this, for sake of discussion, assume that array A has 3200 elements. We partition array A into 32 parts, from [0..99], [100..199], … [3100..3199].a.Consider the case where number of threads=1. In this case, you have only one thread. Hence, it will sort all 32 parts separately one after another. Then, it will merge it. This will correspond to the time required to sort the array with just one thread. This time will be split into two parts: the part that can be parallelized (namely the sorting of individual parts) and the part that cannot be parallelized (namely the merging part). Use this time to evaluate the value of f, the part that is sequential. As an illustration, if the time required for sorting individual parts was 200 and the time required for merging was 25 then f = 25/(200+25).i.Some smart people will realize that the merging itself could be parallielized. But we will not do that in this project. The merging will always be sequential.ii.Note that Amdahl’s law only considers the case where some part can be parallelized by n threads and the remaining part must be run on only one thread. It does not consider the case where you have some part where you can utilize more than one thread but cannot utilize all n.iii.In fact, the merging part will be independent of the number of threads you have.b.Consider the case where K=2. In this case, each thread will sort 16 parts. Each thread will sort the parts assigned to it independently (in parallel). Then, you will merge it to get the sorted array. Recall that the merging must be done sequentially. It is expected that the merging time will remain unchanged in this process.5.What to turn ina.Your .cpp files, .h files and makefile that will generate PROG4b.A report (pdf) describing your experience with Amdahl’s lawi.You should consider five different array sizes from 320 to 32,000,000.ii.The sizes you choose should be such that total time to run with 1 thread is at least 1 second and no more than 10 minutes.iii.For chosen sizes, run your program with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 threads.iv.Run each experiment 3 times and use the average.v.Identify the sequential fraction based on your experiment with 1 thread. Observe that sorting 32 parts can be parallelized. Merging cannot be.vi.Compare the results you have with that predicated by Amdahl’s law.vii.Explain the difference, if any.viii.(Note that the verification time should not be included in the time you report.)6. A few things that will helpa.You saw that you can provide each thread with a threadIDb.You can make assignments of the parts to be sorted based on threadIDc.For example, if you have 4 threads, thread 0 is responsible for first 8 parts and so on.d.You can create partitions in-place7.Some more thingsa.Your sorting or merging should not assume that the array is provided in a sorted fashion. It should work for arbitrary array. The reason I have specified the initial array in the given fashion is so that you can validate correctness of your program. For example, merging cannot be simply put the parts in reverse order.b.Merging would essentially occur in the main() after all threads are joined.c.You are provided with 2 files pth.cpp – that does things somewhat incorrectly (discussed in class) and pth.cpp that does things in the right fashion.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C","slug":"C","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/C/"}]},{"title":"代写C++ CS37 Programming Assignment 1","slug":"page9","date":"2016-10-15T13:42:55.000Z","updated":"2016-10-15T17:34:05.800Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/15/page9/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/15/page9/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction一个简单的c++程序，计算BMI指数，重点在于注意细节，c++的标准I/O的输入输出格式输出RequirementTotal Point: 12 Due Date: 09/12/2016, MondayAssignment Description:Write a program that calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI).

Yourcoding style should be consistent with standard coding conventions (as in Assignment1).• Your programs will be marked on CSIT machines using Java SE 8.0. You should testyour program on these machines before you submit. Task SpecificationYou are to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the MyTi system of Assignment 1. Youwill also make running of the MyTi system more configurable by reading initial Card, Userand TravelPass information from input files and write updated information to an output file.You do not need to add any other new functionality to the MyTi system of Assignment 1. What if my Assignment 1 did not work properly?• If you did not get TravelPass purchasing and Journey-taking working fully in Assignment1 then you are allowed to just purchase a TravelPass (as in the first Sample Run). Part A: Packages and Organisation of Code (0.5 marks)You should organise your code into 3 packages. A package called myti should be used forcode from Assignment 1. Packages called gui and fileio should contain all new code forAssignment 2 (you can put some of your existing code into these packages, if necessary). Part B: Command-Line Arguments (0.5 mark)You are to use command-line arguments to provide the name of your input and output files.For example, if your main() program is in the class Assign3 and you read input frominput.txt and your output is output.txt, then you would run your program as followsfrom the command-line on a unix machine:&gt; java Assign2 input.txt output.txtIf you use eclipse, then you specify the arguments under Run &gt; Run Configurations;however, as always, your program will be marked by running it from the command-line. Part C: File Input and Output (1.5 marks)Put initial TravelPass prices and Card andUser information in a text file (the name of this fileis the first command-line argument); your program should read this file at start-up andinitialise prices and create Users with the appropriate values. A sample input file will beprovided on Blackboard: you must follow that format precisely, though you are welcome toinclude more information than in that sample.Your program will be tested with different values (but with the same format) so makesure you can handle reading the file properly.When the SAVE option is selected on the GUI, you should write an output (text) file. Theoutput file must use the identical format to input file format below. You should write out thesame information as you read in with the updated values. Part D: Graphical User Interface (6 marks)Add a GUI for at least the following functionalities from Assignment 1. (You can implementa GUI that covers your complete Assignment 1 functionality but there’s no extra marks in it.)• The GUI should begin with a single window for purchasing Travel Passes and takingJourneys. Buttons for “Managing Cards and Users” and for “Display Reports” may openup new windows. See the sample GUI on Blackboard;• The Take a Journey window should include:o a list for selecting a Card id (i.e., Take a Journey on this Card);o lists to select 2 stations;o a list to select the day of travel, and an input box to enter the time;o a message box where error messages or other output is displayed;o CANCEL and PURCHASE buttons;• The Manage Passes and Users screen should include:o a list of Card IDs and associated User names;o when a Card is selected, User details and remaining credit is displayed;o an input box and an ADD CREDIT button for adding credit for the selected Card:when this is performed, credit for that Card is displayed / updated;o a message box where error messages or other output is displayed;o an Add a User panel that obtains the required information for a new user and addsthem. When a User is created, there should be an option to register a Card to thatUser;• The Display Reports screen should include:o a single Display All Journeys button;o a scrollable text box that contains the list of Journeys.o Note, if in Assignment 1 your function just displayed the Journeys for a Card, thenyou can do this here: you’ll need a drop-down box to select the Card to display;• SAVE and QUIT (without saving) buttons should always be available (ideally, outsidethe JTabbedPane).• Each window will need buttons to open the other window options: for full marks, if awindow is already open then it just shows it on top of the others, not generate a new one.Obvious GUI errors should be checked—for example, if the user tries to ADD CREDITwithout first selecting a Card from the menu.Sample screens will be added to Blackboard. You do NOT have to follow these designs; theyare simply a suggestion and you are free to design your own screens, as long as your GUIfunctionality is completely clear.• GUI Demo: 1 / 0.5 marks of the GUI functionality will be for a demo in Week 10 / 11;this can be of “click” functionality that isn’t fully connected to the MyTi system. Part E: Other (1.5 marks)As always, marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layoutand clarity, meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of datastructures and other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with yourtutors and lab assistants, or with the coding mentors. Bonus Task (1 mark)Instead of reading/writing from files, read/write from a database using JDBC.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"},{"name":"sqlite","slug":"sqlite","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/sqlite/"}]},{"title":"代写C   IP1  lab1","slug":"page7","date":"2016-10-13T14:13:33.000Z","updated":"2016-10-13T14:19:47.064Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/13/page7/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/13/page7/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction实现一个Wumpus的teriminal端的游戏（println），输出一个44的表格，有玩家、恶魔、陷阱、金币，玩家遇到恶魔或者陷阱就游戏Lose，捡完所有的金币就游戏Win，同时玩家可以感知恶魔 陷阱 金币的提示。这个作业 时间是12小时，然后比较麻烦的是需求给的不太清楚，需要结合网上的Wumpus游戏和作业需求综合理解，设计一个简易的Wumpus游戏，画出UML图，然后code。RequirementWumpus!Wumpus is a text-based game, where a player moves through a cave system searchingfor gold and trying to avoid bottomless pits and a feared Wumpus. The cave system isa 4 x 4 grid. Each grid element can hold one GameItem. A GameItem is one of: Gold,Pit, Wumpus or ClearGround.The player can move forward, backward, left or right one grid element at a time. Thecave system wraps around so, for example, moving left from position [3][0] causesthe player to appear in position [3][3].The player can sense, but not see, what is in the immediate grid elements around theplayer. A pit will be sensed as a breeze, gold as a faint glitter and the Wumpus as avile smell. In this assignment, the grid will be displayed, but in a real game thisfeature would be disabled.If the player moves onto a pit or the Wumpus, the player dies and the game ends.If the player moves onto gold, the game score increases by one and the gold isreplaced by ClearGround.Implementation:You should write a Game class, which has a 2D array of size 4 x 4 of GameItem calledboard for implementing the Wumpus game described above.Classes Gold, Pit, Wumpus and ClearGround are extensions of class GameItem.GameItem should provide a public method, display(), for use when displaying theboard and a private instance variable for specifying the displayed character. Gold isdisplayed as ‘g’, a Pit as ‘p’, the Wumpus as ‘W’, clear ground as ‘.’ . GameItemprovides a constructor GameItem(char c) for specifying the displayed character.It should not be possible to instantiate an object of GameItem. The player is notimplemented as an object, instead just being represented by Game as private row &amp;column coordinates. The position of the player is displayed by a ‘‘.The items should be positioned randomly over board. There is exactly one Wumpus,at least one, and up to three pieces of gold (chosen randomly) and exactly three pits.The player is positioned over a ClearGround position.Game should provide:? a private method setBoard(), which instantiates objects on the board? a private method display() which will display the board.? a private method senseNearby(), which displays text about what theplayer can sense from the board elements immediately surroundingthe player.? a private method menu() which will provide a menu asking the user tomake a choice from the following and obtain the user input:=====Wumpus====1. Move player left2. Move player right3. Move player up4. Move player down 5Quit? a public method runGame() that will display the board, print out whatthe player can sense, present the menu and process the user’s decisionaccording to the game play described above.The World class only instantiates an object myGame of class Game, and callsmyGame.runGame()You need to show the Pit , Wumpus and Gold when the game is being played and alsoshow the SenseNearby() field as this is testing your ability to utilize polymorphism to callmethod of different classes.GameItem display() method is used to display each game item.Game display() method is used to loop through GameItem array to display the board.You may find the class Random, available in java.util.* useful.For example the following will assign integer variable guess a value from 0..4inclusive.Random randomGenerator = new Random();guess = randomGenerator.nextInt(5);.Submission:? Due date: 9am 10th Oct 2016. Representing 30% of course assessment? This is a group assignment of maximum 3 students (prefer not solo)? You will need to submit 7 electronic files, (Game.java, GameItem.java, Gold.java, Pit.java,Wumpus.java, ClearGround.java and World. Please note these must be Java source files (e.g.World.java), not class files (i.e not World.class). We will not mark a class file.? This assignment needs to be well designed. Please draw the Class diagram of your finalcoding design Please screenshot a full set of successful executions. Save the class diagramand screenshots of executions in a PDF file called Design.pdf.? Weblearn is used for submission. Please zip all source files and Design.pdf into one forsubmission (7z, rar, zipx or other compression format will be penalized).? Remember to include all team members’ names, student IDs and contribution % of eachperson in you submission of Design.pdf in the first page. One submission one group andmultiple submission will be penalized or at your own risk of getting wrong marks.Standard warning:This assignment must be your own work. Any submission found in whole or in part tobe plagiarized will be given zero marks and will not count towards your assessment. Ifan award of zero marks means that you do not pass the assignment hurdle then you willfail the course.Frequent Asked QuestionsQuestion: I was just wondering if the Wumpus will be moving around the board aswell? Or will it be stationary like the position of the pits?Answer: The Wumpus position is randomly generated. In each session, it will not bemove around. It will be stationary like the position of the pits.Question: Is there only 1 pit, 1 gold and 1 Wumpus in the game?Answer: There is exactly one Wumpus, at least one, and up to three pieces of gold(chosen randomly) and exactly three pits. The player is positioned over a ClearGroundpositionQuestion: Hey I’m hoping to submit and wanted to know if the tutor name isimportant, I’m not sure who my tutor is.Answer: The tutor’s name is not important. You can just submit to the default one.Yes, all files need to be zipped into one file. The zip file name is not important asweblearn will auto rename it.Question: Is it like after generate Wumpus, pit and gold, the position of these objectsare settled, no matter where the player moves on the board, these objects are notmoving? Or, each time player moves a step, the position of W,P and G changesrandomly? If player is surrounded by more than one objects, senseNearby() shouldoutput all information of themAnswer: After randomly generate W, P, G in the beginning of the game, these objectsare settled in position. Only replaced by “.” if player walks into it, like gold.Yes, senseNearby() should output all information of up, down, left and right.Question: At starting do I need to display 4X4 Grid along with GameItems like ( 1Wumpus, 3 Pit and 3 Gold).I meant player basically see all gameItems position in thegrid (not like real game) at the beginning of the game.Answer: Yes, you do need to display 4x4 grid along with GameItems at the startingpoint.Question: After each user selection from Menu do I need to display grid along withgameItems position again.Answer: Yes that is why you call display() method in the Game class.Marking Guide:OO Components 12 marksFunctional correct 12 marksDocumentation, Coding Style, Submission requirement, Error checking 8 marks","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"}]},{"title":"代写C   IP1  lab1","slug":"page6","date":"2016-10-09T06:23:32.000Z","updated":"2016-10-11T15:47:45.631Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/09/page6/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/09/page6/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction是电路和C语言的结合，电阻串联并联，然后用欧姆定律求总的电流。 实现了三个function，一个欧姆定律function，一个串联function，一个并联function。RequirementAs electrical engineering students, you are familiar with Ohm’s Law (V = IR) and calculating the value of resistors in series (R = R1+R2) and parallel (1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2).

Every line starting with a symbol # is a comment; the first non-comment line contains the integer values for MAX X and MAX Y, which are 100 and 100 in this file; the second non-comment line contains the number of points NUM PT, which is 10 in this file; the other non-comment lines present the integer x- and y-coordinates for the points, one in a line (in a non-specific order).In all three assignments, the input files all follow such a file format, except that the values of thevariables can be different and the comment lines can be missing. Each file is called an instance, and the file name convention is to start with “instance”, followed by the number of points in the instance, then an underscore, the index of instance having the same number of points, and lastly the file suffix “.txt”.That is, “instanceXXX YYY.txt” is the YYY-th (may or may not be left-patched with 0’s) instance having XXX points; for example, the above “instance10 001.txt” is the first instance having 10 points.The following list contains the specifications for Assignment #1 (10 marks in total):1. Write a single program with multiple functions, using the command-line options. Suppose yourprogram name is “myprogram”. If a command-line is incorrect, your program prints out the followingand then quits (function #1):&gt;myprogram [-i inputfile [-o outputfile]]2. One function (function #2) of your program is to read in the content of an instance file. To read inthe file “instance10 001.txt” you will execute the command:&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txtHere “-i” is the command-line option that indicates the succeeding argument is the input filename.3. Your program will check the correctness of the file content (function #3) during reading. That is, to check that the first non-comment line contains two integer values for MAX X and MAX Y, the second non-comment line contains an integer value for the number of points NUM PT (this number also appears in the filename; your program does not need to validate this, but to always use the number read in from the file), and there are exactly NUM PT more lines, each contains two integer values for the x-and y-coordinates of a point. Your program also makes sure that no coordinate is out of the specified rectangular area, neither there can be duplicate points in the instance.If your program encounters an error, then reports what the error is and quits; otherwise, continue to the next item.4. With the correctness been checked, your program will print (function #4) out the non-comment lines of the input file to the screen, when using the command:&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txtIf an output filename is specified, using either of the following commands:&gt;myprogram -i instance10 001.txt -o output.txt&gt;myprogram -o output.txt -i instance10 001.txtwhere “-o” is the command-line option that indicates the succeeding argument is the output filename,then instead of printing to the screen all the non-comment lines of the input file are written into the file “output.txt”.5. If your program is not fed with an input file, that is, by executing the following command:&gt;myprogramthen your program will generate several instances (function #5) through a user interface as follows:Generating random instances …Enter the circuit board size MAX_X MAX_Y:Enter the number of points NUM_PT:Enter the number of random instances to be generated:Assume the user inputs areGenerating random instances …Enter the circuit board size MAX_X MAX_Y: 100 200Enter the number of points NUM_PT: 10Enter the number of random instances to be generated: 7your program will generate in total 7 instances, written into 7 separate files “instance10 j.txt”,for j = 1, 2, …, 7.

If n is the x th digit ofthe y th line with digits, with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim , then• n is to be associated with a point situated x × 0.5 cm to the right and y × 0.5 cm below an origin,• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right just in case n = 1 or n = 3, and• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm below itself just in case n = 2 or n = 3.The last digit on every line with digits cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and the digits on the last line withdigits cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which ensures that the input encodes a maze, that is, a grid of width(x dim −1)×0.5 cm and of height (y dim −1)×0.5 cm (hence of maximum width 15 cm and of maximumheight 20 cm), with possibly gaps on the sides and inside. A point not connected to any of its neighboursis thought of as a pillar; a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought of as part of a wall.We talk about inner point to refer to a point that lies (x+0.5)×0.5 cm to the right of and (y+0.5)×0.5cm below the origin with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim − 1 and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim − 1.4.2 OutputIf not run as either python3 maze.py –file filename.txt or as python3 maze.py -print –filefilename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program shouldprint out a single line that readsI expect –file followed by filename and possibly -print as command line arguments.and immediately exit.

Note that your program should output no blankline. For a given test, the output of your program will be compared with the expected output; yourprogram will pass the test if and only if both outputs are absolutely identical, character for character,including spaces. For the provided examples, the expected outputs are available in files that end in_output.txt. To check that the output of your program on those examples is correct, you can redirectit to a file and compare the contents of that file with the contents of the appropriate _output.txt fileusing the diff command. If diff silently exits then your program passes the test; otherwise it fails it.For instance, runpython3 maze.py –file maze1.txt &gt;maze1_my_output.txtand thendiff maze1_my_output.txt maze1_output.txtto check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.4.3 When the program is run with -print as command-line argumentIf the input is correct and the program is run as If the input is correct and the program is run aspython3 maze.py -print –file filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that storesthe input) then the program should output some lines saved in a file named filename.tex, that can begiven as an argument to pdflatex to produce a file named filename.pdf that depicts the maze. Theprovided examples will show you what filename.tex should contain.• Walls are drawn in blue. There is a command for every longest segment that is part of a wall.Horizontal segments are drawn starting with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing withthe bottommost rightmost segment. Then vertical segments are drawn starting with the topmostleftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment.• Pillars are drawn as green circles.• Inner points in accessible cul-de-sacs are drawn as red crosses.• The paths with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs are drawn as dashed yellow lines. There is acommand for every longest segment on such a path. Horizontal segments are drawn starting withthe topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with thosesegments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm. Then vertical segments are drawn startingwith the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, withthose segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm.Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces and blank lines. Lines that start with % arecomments; there are 4 such lines, that have to be present even when there is no item to be displayed ofthe kind described by the comment. The output of your program redirected to a file will be comparedwith the expected output saved in a file (of a different name of course) using the diff command. Foryour program to pass the associated test, diff should silently exit, which requires that the contents ofboth files be absolutely identical, character for character, including spaces and blank lines. Check yourprogram on the provided examples using the associated .tex files. For instance, run7python3 maze.py -print –file maze1.txtand thendiff maze1.tex maze1_expected.texto check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.5 Submission and assessment5.1 SubmissionYour program will be stored in a file named maze.py. After you have developed and tested your program,upload your files using WebCMS. Assignments can be submitted more than once: the last version ismarked. Your assignment is due by October 2, 11:59pm.5.2 AssessmentUp to 8 marks will reward correctness of solutions by automatically testing your program on some tests,all different to the provided examples. Read carefully the part on program output to maximise yourchances of not failing some tests for stupid reasons. For each test, the automarking script will let yourprogram run for 30 seconds. Still you should not take advantage of this and strive for a solution thatgives an immediate output for any input.Up to 2 marks will reward good comments, good choice of names for identifiers and functions, readabilityof code, simplicity of statements, compactness of functions. This will be determined manually.Late assignments will be penalised: the mark for a late submission will be the minimum of the awardedmark and 10 minus the number of full and partial days that have elapsed from the due date.The outputs of your programs should be exactly as indicated.5.3 Reminder on plagiarism policyYou are permitted, indeed encouraged, to discuss ways to solve the assignment with other people. Suchdiscussions must be in terms of algorithms, not code. But you must implement the solution on yourown. Submissions are routinely scanned for similarities that occur when students copy and modify otherpeople’s work, or work very closely together on a single implementation. Severe penalties apply to asubmission that is not the original work of the person submitting it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithmics","slug":"Algorithmics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithmics/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Python","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Python/"}]},{"title":"代写java COSE60507  Algorithmics","slug":"page2","date":"2016-09-30T17:52:31.000Z","updated":"2016-10-02T15:51:22.652Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/10/01/page2/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/10/01/page2/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction实现binary sequence search tree（BSST）以及实现其升级版本AVL Tree，评分点比较详细，需要做对比分析以及实现，代码实现不能使用library，最终提交code和report，应客户要求，分别用Java、C#、C、C++四种语言进行了实现。RequirementScenario: GlobalQuiz is a popular mobile multiplayer quiz game. Each registered player has a unique numerical id. The GlobalQuiz server maintains a list in memory of the players currently playing the game. This list can be considered a data dictionary, where the numerical id is the key, and the player details is the data.The data dictionary adt implements the following operations: proc insert ( int key) ;pointer fun find( int key ) ;proc delete( int key );Currently the player list is stored as list in an array, ordered by key. When a player logs on to the game, their details are added to the back of the list and sifted to the correct position using one pass of an insertion sort. When the server needs to access a player’s details, it conducts a binary search. When a player leaves the game, their details are deleted from the list, and the remaining entries are moved down to fill the gap.GlobalQuiz has become very popular, with thousands of players connected at once. Its makers would like to explore whether there is a more efficient way of storing the player details. They would like to use a tree-like structure, and are considering a binary sequence search tree (BSST).Task: Original List Implementation: Write a program implementing the list, as described above, in a language of your choice from Java, C#, C++ or C. Your program should contain one class implementing the ADT, and a main method or GUI which allows each method to be tested. Your implementation simply needs to store a list of integers – the keys. [15 marks]State and justify the big-O efficiency of each method in the original list implementation.

This assignment is organized into three weekly milestones (Week1, Week2, and Week3). At the end of each milestone, you will submit code and receive feedback on your progress through zyLabs. Your learning goals for this assignment include:Incrementally develop a complete Java application from a high-level specification.Design algorithms that account for basic computer input, output, memory, and processing.Iteratively test and debug code throughout the development process.Document code with comments and appropriate styling according to the guides.Build expressions using basic operators: logical, arithmetic, and string-based.Distinguish different types of data, and identify the most appropriate types for all variables.Utilize conditional and looping flow control, both in isolation and in nested structures.Utilize the print and println methods in System.out, to display formatted output.Utilize a single Scanner object to read input from the console.Perform input validation on the user’s input.Your grade for this program includes:Weekly Milestone Progress36% Program compiles and passes the weekly automated tests in zyLabs. Each weekly milestone is includes three automated tests, and each of these tests are each worth 4% of your total program grade.Final Program Functionality44% Program compiles and passes additional automated tests for both functionality and conformance to the program specification. For example, your program should avoid using features that have not yet been covered in previous zyBooks chapters including: Arrays, User-Defined Methods, Additional Classes, Exception Handling, Packages (outside the default), Etc.Style and Structure10% Program uses appropriate variable names, spacing, and control structures in conformance with the CS302 Style Guide, and to make code easier to read.Documentation10% Program is appropriately commented in a way that is meaningful for readers who understand Java, but are not familiar with the logic or purpose of your code. These comments should conform to the CS302 Commenting Guide.Each CS302 student is expected to individually complete this assignment (this is NOT a team assignment). While you are encouraged to discuss general algorithms, and the behavior or syntax for specific java programming constructs, you are NOT allowed to share code for this assignment in any form. All of the code that you submit with this assignment should either be conceived-of and manually typed into the computer by you, or it should be provided for you through this website. AVOID leaving any code in widely accessible places, like: on an unsecured computer or on a widely accessible (non-password protected) website. Remember, all piazza posts that include assignment code or fragments must be marked as private so they are only visible to the poster and the course’s instructional staff.Week1 – Ask Me One QuestionCreate a new Java Project in Eclipse. You can name this project whatever you want, but Program1 is a sensible name. Next download theReviewQuiz.java and P1.jar files (try right-clicking to “Save Link As…” these files). Copy this .java file into the src folder within your new Java project’s folder, and copy this .jar file into your project folder itself (outside of the src folder). You may need to select Refresh from the File menu (or press F5), if you cannot immediately see these files in the Package Explorer within Eclipse. In order to use the provided P1.jar file, you’ll need to right-click on this file within the Package Explorer and select “Add to Build Path…” from the “Build Path” sub menu. Your entire program for this assignment should be implemented within the main method of this ReviewQuiz.java file. Remember to follow the course Style Guide and Commenting Guide as you develop this program. Also remember to regularly test (compile and run) your program as you develop it.As soon as your program begins, it should display the following welcome message:Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!And just before your program ends, it should display the following closing message (both of these messages should include the demonstrated row of equals symbols):Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!After displaying the welcome message, your program should ask the user to enter their email address to identify them as a particular user:Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduNote that the orange text above indicate text that was entered by the user. Although your program will not use this information until the next milestone, your program should read in this email address and store it for later use.Before asking the user a question, you will solicit advice on which sections the user is interested in reviewing. The P1.getSections() method evaluates to a String that includes a list of numbered section names. For example:1 String sectionText P1.getSections();After printing out this list, your code should prompt the user for their choice, read in their integer response, and store it for later use. Note that if adding this P1.getSections() instruction to your code produces an error stating that P1 cannot be resolved, it is likely that the P1.jar file was not correctly added to your project, and you should double check that you correctly followed the instructions in step 0. If all is well, this part of your program should look like the following when it is run:SECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1Note: Your program should only use a single Scanner object to read all user input. Creating and using multiple “new Scanner(System.in)” objects produces behavior that is not defined in the Java specification, could cause trouble for some auto grading tools, and is likely to lose you points on this assignment. So don’t do it :).Next we’ll present the user with their first question. The P1.getQuestion() method should evaluate to a String containing a question for the user. But if you try to retrieve this string before choosing a section that there are questions within, you will see the following error message. Try this out now!Exception in thread “main” java.lang.RuntimeException: No questions were available for the selected sections.This P1.getQuestion() method is stateful, which means that it may evaluate to different String values depending on what code ran before it. In order to get a question from the user’s chosen section, we must first call P1.toggleSection( 1 ); This will cause P1.getQuestion() to resolve as a String containing a question from section 1. You should replace this 1, with an expression that evaluates to the section that was chosen by the user, so they instead see a question from the section that they have chosen. When the user chooses a section that there are no questions for, your program will crash showing the above message (this will be fixed in the last milestone). Otherwise, they should see a question from the section that they previously selected. Note that the provided questions (you will eventually be able to add more questions of your own) are within sections 1 and 2.Update 9/13: The P1.toggleSection method should be called immedaitely after reading in the user’s section choice. If you print anything out to the screen between reading in the user’s choice and calling P1.toggleSection, your code will run into problems with one of the automated milestone1 tests.Now it is time to read in the user’s answer to the previous multiple choice question. This question should always be a letter: usually A, B, C, … but T, F and other single letter answers are possible. After they answer this question, they should see the correct answer displayed on the screen. You can retrieve the correct answer by using the method P1.getAnswer() which returns this answer as a single char. Here is what a complete run of this program might look like at this point (note the expected vertical whitespace in this example):Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1[T]rue or [F]alse: Every variable in java has both a type and a value.Enter your answer: TThe correct answer is: TThank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Review the code that you have written so far, and after you are satisfied that it conforms to the above specifications, submit a copy of your working ReviewQuiz.java code along with this P1.java placeholder file (since we cannot updload jar files) to zyBooks. Note that there should not be any need to add this P1.java to your Eclipse project, and that doing so is likely to create name conflicts with the P1.jar file that you are already using. If the automated tests detect any errors with your code, you can fix your code and resubmit it as many times as you’d like (however, you’ll have to wait 60 minutes between submissions). You will be awarded points based on your submission that earns the most points prior to the due date: 8:00am on Thursday, September 15th.Week2 – As You WishStart by extending your program from Milestone1 to ask the user to enter a new review problem after they answer the question and before the program’s closing message is displayed. Here’s an example of what these new prompts and user-input should look like:Enter a multiple choice question (in one line of text):[T]rue or [F]alse, statements in Java end with a semicolon.Enter the correct answer for this question (one letter): TSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsEnter the section for this problem: 1There are just a couple more steps before this question that the user has answered is added to their local database. First, your code should give the user a chance to proof read their question and either confirm or deny that it should be added.Please proofread your problem and confirm you would like to submit it (Y/N): YThank you for submitting this new problem.A response of Y should result in the feedback demonstrated above, and a call to the method P1.submitProblem() which takes four arguments between the parentheses:1 P1.submitProblem( q, a, s, e );The “q” above should be replaced with the String question entered by the use, the “a” with their char answer as an upper-case letter, the “s” with their int section number, and the “e” with their String email address. After this method is called, the final step required to commit this new question to the local database is to call the method P1.done(). You can call this method once at the end of your program, after the closing message is displayed. It may be helpful to leave this line commented out as you work, to avoid adding extra questions to the database. Otherwise you may find it helpful to occasionally delete the file within your project folder that is named “db” to refresh your local question database to contain only the default provided questions.When the user enters anything other than the letter ‘Y’ (either upper-case or lower-case) in response to the confirmation prompt above, your program should NOT call P1.submitProblem() and instead of displaying the “Thank you for submitting this new problem” response demonstrated above, it should display the following:Problem was NOT submitted.Update 9/16: Note that the zyBooks tests will expect that you have converted the answer letter that was entered by the user into upper-case (if it was entered in lower-case) before calling the P1.submitProblem() method.Next we’ll revisit our question and answer code to provide different feedback based on whether the user’s answer is correct. When they enter the correct answer, your program should print out the following response:That’s correct!!!and when the enter an incorrect answer your program should display the correct answer:The correct answer is: TNote that this is only what the prompt should look like when the correct answer is T, and the user has answered something other than T. Both lower-case and upper-case letter T inputs should be treated as correct.Now let’s give the user a chance to rate the difficulty of the question that they just answered, and to see how difficult others have found this questions. The prompts and user-input for this should look as follows (and should be presented to the user after they have seen whether their answer was correct or not):Please rate the difficulty of this problem (1-easy to 5-hard, or 0-report): 2The average rating for this question has been: 2.25Of course the specific values entered and displayed here may vary. And as you may have guessed by now, there are a couple of provided methods that you can use to submit and check these user ratings: P1.submitRating(2) to submit a rating of 2 (or change this 2 to match the user’s input) and P1.getRating() to retrieve the current question’s average rating (which was 2.25 in the example above).As the final step in this milestone, we’ll add some menu options for the user to choose whether they would like to 1) Answer a Question, 2) Submit a Problem, or 3) Quit the program. The user will enter A, S, or Q to choose between these options, and then only answer a question or submit a new question before seeing the final closing message. When the user chooses to Quit, they should immediately see the closing message. And when the user enters anything other than an A, S, or Q (or a, s, or q), they should see a message stating the following before the program’s closing message and end:Sorry, but that menu choice was not recognized.Here are a couple of sample runs of the program at this point to see everything working together, and also to demonstrate the required spacing (notice that each main menu option is indented by four spaces):Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: aSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1[T]rue or [F]alse: Every variable in java has both a type and a value.Enter your answer: FThe correct answer is: TPlease rate the difficulty of this problem (1-easy to 5-hard, or 0-report): 2The average rating for this question has been: 2.2Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: SEnter a multiple choice question (in one line of text):This is a pretty silly example: A) wrong, B) incorrect, C) correct, D) bad answerEnter the correct answer for this question (one letter): CSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsEnter the section for this problem: 2Please proofread your problem and confirm you would like to submit it (Y/N): yThank you for submitting this new problem.Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: WSorry, but that menu choice was not recognized.Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: qThank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!After reviewing your code and convincing yourself that it conforms to the above specifications, submit your ReviewQuiz.java file along with this placeholder P1.java file to zyBooks P1 Milestone2. If the automated tests report any errors, attempt to debug your code and submit it again. You are allowed one feedback submission per hour. Your results on these tests will be recorded for points at 8:00am on Thursday, September 22nd.Notice that we have not added very much code to handle unexpected user input. Giving the user another chance to enter a number instead of crashing when the user types in two to select section 2 would be nice. It might also be nice to ensure that they only select section numbers that are within the correct range. Another possibility would be ensure that the email address entered by the user actually conforms to the format of a proper email address. For this programming assignment, we will not be testing your program against these kinds of erroneous inputs. However we certainly encourage you to think about how you could change you code to better deal with these kinds of potential problems. If you would like to try implementing some of these types of changes, please make a separate copy of your work to experiment with. This should help us avoid unanticipated problems that our automated grading tools might encounter with these kinds of customizations.Week3 – More, More, MoreOur Milestone2 ReviewQuiz.java program currently only presents the user with one question when it is run, so we’ll start this section by extending that functionality to present the user with multiple questions. Replace the “[A]nswer a Question” option in your program’s main menu with these two new options: [R]andom Sample Quiz (fixed number of problems) [P]roficiency Quiz (fixed number of correct answers)After selecting either of these options, the user will be asked to choose a section to be asked questions from, and will then be repeatedly: presented with a question, given feedback on it’s correct answer, and then prompted to rate that question and be shown it’s current rating (based on the code you wrote in milestone2).The “[R]andom Sample Quiz” option will ask the user a fixed number of questions. This number is specified by the user in response to the following prompt, which should be displayed after the section selection, and before the first question is asked:Enter the number of problems to review: 3The “[P]roficiency Quiz” option will instead ask the user as many questions as it takes for them to answer a specific number of those questions correctly. The number of correct answers that will end the program will be input using the following prompt (again, between the section selection and first question):Enter the number of correct answers needed to stop: 2Note that every time you call the P1.getQuestion(), P1.getAnswer(), and P1.getRating() methods, you retrieve the current question, answer, and rating. Each time you call the method P1.gotoNextProblem(), these other methods will retrieve the question, answer, and rating for a different problem, so it will be helpful to call this between questions.You should also display an increasing problem number in front of each question, so that the output of your program matches the following:Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [R]andom Sample Quiz (fixed number of problems) [P]roficiency Quiz (fixed number of correct answers) [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: rSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a question from: 1Enter the number of problems to review: 31.

Update the section selection code to present the user with multiple prompts until they enter -1 and have selected sections with at least one question in the database. There is a method called P1.questionsAvailable() that evaluates to true when the selected sections contain at least one question. Only call this method when the user enters -1 to determine whether that input should end the section selection loop. Also notice that the P1.getSections() methods already displays selected sections with square brackets around them.

We’ll rely on the convention that the user enters the word END on a line by itself to indicate that the previous lines contain their entire question.

This will allow the user to take as many quizzes and submit as many problems as they’d like within a single execution of the program. Note that when multiple quizzes are taken in a single execution, the default section selection from one quiz will persist as the default selection for the next quiz. Thisis the expected behavior for your program, so you don’t need to worry about tracking or clearing these old selections.

As with the previous milestones, you should submit your final ReviewQuiz.java file along with this placeholder P1.java file via zyBooks for feedback on the Week3 Milestone features. If the automated tests report any errors, attempt to debug your code and submit it again.After this program has been completed, we’ll release a replacement for the P1.jar file that you have been using up to this point. Instead of storing and retrieving problems locally from your computer, it will store and retrieve problems from the cloud so that you can share these review materials with your classmates.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Java","slug":"Java","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Java/"},{"name":"Autotest","slug":"Autotest","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Autotest/"}]}]}
