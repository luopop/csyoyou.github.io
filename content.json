Each registered player has a unique numerical id. The GlobalQuiz server maintains a list in memory of the players currently playing the game. This list can be considered a data dictionary, where the numerical id is the key, and the player details is the data.The data dictionary adt implements the following operations: proc insert ( int key) ;pointer fun find( int key ) ;proc delete( int key );Currently the player list is stored as list in an array, ordered by key. When a player logs on to the game, their details are added to the back of the list and sifted to the correct position using one pass of an insertion sort. When the server needs to access a player’s details, it conducts a binary search. When a player leaves the game, their details are deleted from the list, and the remaining entries are moved down to fill the gap.GlobalQuiz has become very popular, with thousands of players connected at once. Its makers would like to explore whether there is a more efficient way of storing the player details. They would like to use a tree-like structure, and are considering a binary sequence search tree (BSST).Task: Original List Implementation: Write a program implementing the list, as described above, in a language of your choice from Java, C#, C++ or C. Your program should contain one class implementing the ADT, and a main method or GUI which allows each method to be tested. Your implementation simply needs to store a list of integers – the keys. [15 marks]State and justify the big-O efficiency of each method in the original list implementation. [5 marks]BSST proposal Describe and discuss, using diagrams, high-level pseudocode and a big-O analysis of each method, the advantages and disadvantages of using a Binary Sequence Search Tree (BSST) to implement the ADT. [15 marks]A better tree implementation Choose either the Order 2 B-Tree or an AVL Tree, and explain, using diagrams, high-level pseudocode, and big-O analysis, how it could be implemented and its advantages and disadvantages compared to the BSST proposal. [15 marks] Write a program implementing your chosen data structure in the language of your choice. [20 marks]Conclusion Summarise your analysis in a table, showing the big-O efficiencies of each of the three operations (insert, find and delete) for each of the 3 implementations. Which implementation do you recommend for the GlobalQuiz scenario and why? Would the recommendation be different for different usage scenarios? [10 marks]Further Discussion Research and describe further implementations (such as other types of tree) that GlobalQuiz could consider. What are their advantages and disadvantages?

If n is the x th digit ofthe y th line with digits, with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim , then• n is to be associated with a point situated x × 0.5 cm to the right and y × 0.5 cm below an origin,• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm to its right just in case n = 1 or n = 3, and• n is to be connected to the point 0.5 cm below itself just in case n = 2 or n = 3.The last digit on every line with digits cannot be equal to 1 or 3, and the digits on the last line withdigits cannot be equal to 2 or 3, which ensures that the input encodes a maze, that is, a grid of width(x dim −1)×0.5 cm and of height (y dim −1)×0.5 cm (hence of maximum width 15 cm and of maximumheight 20 cm), with possibly gaps on the sides and inside. A point not connected to any of its neighboursis thought of as a pillar; a point connected to at least one of its neighbours is thought of as part of a wall.We talk about inner point to refer to a point that lies (x+0.5)×0.5 cm to the right of and (y+0.5)×0.5cm below the origin with 0 ≤ x &lt; x dim − 1 and 0 ≤ y &lt; y dim − 1.4.2 OutputIf not run as either python3 maze.py –file filename.txt or as python3 maze.py -print –filefilename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program shouldprint out a single line that readsI expect –file followed by filename and possibly -print as command line arguments.and immediately exit. Otherwise, if the input is incorrect, that is, does not satisfy the conditions spelledout in the previous section, then the program should print out a single line that readsIncorrect input.and immediately exit.4.2.1 When the program is run without -print as command-line argumentIf the input is correct and the program is run as python3 maze.py –file filename.txt (wherefilename.txt is the name of a file that stores the input) then the program should output a first linethat reads one ofThe maze has no gate.The maze has a single gate.The maze has N gates.5with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a second line that reads one ofThe maze has no wall.The maze has a single wall that are all connected.The maze has N sets of walls that are all connected.with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a third line that reads one ofThe maze has no inaccessible inner point.The maze has a unique inaccessible inner point.The maze has N inaccessible inner points.with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fourth line that reads one ofThe maze has no accessible area.The maze has a unique accessible area.The maze has N accessible areas.with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, a fifth line that reads one ofThe maze has no accessible cul-de-sac.The maze has accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.The maze has N sets of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected.with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2, and a sixth line that reads one ofThe maze has no entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.The maze has a unique entry-exit path with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs.The maze has N entry-exit paths with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs.with N an appropriate integer at least equal to 2.• A gate is any pair of consecutive points on one of the four sides of the maze that are not connected.• An inaccessible inner point is an inner point that cannot be reached from any gate.• An accessible area is a maximal set of inner points that can all be accessed from the same gate (sothe number of accessible inner points is at most equal to the number of gates).• A set of accessible cul-de-sacs that are all connected is a maximal set S of connected inner pointsthat can all be accessed from the same gate g and such that for all points p in S, if p has beenaccessed from g for the first time, then either p is in a dead end or moving on without ever gettingback leads into a dead end.• An entry-exit path with no intersections not to cul-de-sacs is a maximal set S of connected innerpoints that go from a gate to another (necessarily different) gate and such that for all points p inS, there is only one way to move on from p without getting back and without entering a cul-de-sac.6Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces. Note that your program should output no blankline. For a given test, the output of your program will be compared with the expected output; yourprogram will pass the test if and only if both outputs are absolutely identical, character for character,including spaces. For the provided examples, the expected outputs are available in files that end in_output.txt. To check that the output of your program on those examples is correct, you can redirectit to a file and compare the contents of that file with the contents of the appropriate _output.txt fileusing the diff command. If diff silently exits then your program passes the test; otherwise it fails it.For instance, runpython3 maze.py –file maze1.txt &gt;maze1_my_output.txtand thendiff maze1_my_output.txt maze1_output.txtto check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.4.3 When the program is run with -print as command-line argumentIf the input is correct and the program is run as If the input is correct and the program is run aspython3 maze.py -print –file filename.txt (where filename.txt is the name of a file that storesthe input) then the program should output some lines saved in a file named filename.tex, that can begiven as an argument to pdflatex to produce a file named filename.pdf that depicts the maze. Theprovided examples will show you what filename.tex should contain.• Walls are drawn in blue. There is a command for every longest segment that is part of a wall.Horizontal segments are drawn starting with the topmost leftmost segment and finishing withthe bottommost rightmost segment. Then vertical segments are drawn starting with the topmostleftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment.• Pillars are drawn as green circles.• Inner points in accessible cul-de-sacs are drawn as red crosses.• The paths with no intersection not to cul-de-sacs are drawn as dashed yellow lines. There is acommand for every longest segment on such a path. Horizontal segments are drawn starting withthe topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, with thosesegments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm. Then vertical segments are drawn startingwith the topmost leftmost segment and finishing with the bottommost rightmost segment, withthose segments that end at a gate sticking out by 0.25 cm.Pay attention to the expected format, including spaces and blank lines. Lines that start with % arecomments; there are 4 such lines, that have to be present even when there is no item to be displayed ofthe kind described by the comment. The output of your program redirected to a file will be comparedwith the expected output saved in a file (of a different name of course) using the diff command. Foryour program to pass the associated test, diff should silently exit, which requires that the contents ofboth files be absolutely identical, character for character, including spaces and blank lines. Check yourprogram on the provided examples using the associated .tex files. For instance, run7python3 maze.py -print –file maze1.txtand thendiff maze1.tex maze1_expected.texto check whether your program succeeds on the first provided example.5 Submission and assessment5.1 SubmissionYour program will be stored in a file named maze.py. After you have developed and tested your program,upload your files using WebCMS. Assignments can be submitted more than once: the last version ismarked. Your assignment is due by October 2, 11:59pm.5.2 AssessmentUp to 8 marks will reward correctness of solutions by automatically testing your program on some tests,all different to the provided examples. Read carefully the part on program output to maximise yourchances of not failing some tests for stupid reasons. For each test, the automarking script will let yourprogram run for 30 seconds. Still you should not take advantage of this and strive for a solution thatgives an immediate output for any input.Up to 2 marks will reward good comments, good choice of names for identifiers and functions, readabilityof code, simplicity of statements, compactness of functions. This will be determined manually.Late assignments will be penalised: the mark for a late submission will be the minimum of the awardedmark and 10 minus the number of full and partial days that have elapsed from the due date.The outputs of your programs should be exactly as indicated.5.3 Reminder on plagiarism policyYou are permitted, indeed encouraged, to discuss ways to solve the assignment with other people. Suchdiscussions must be in terms of algorithms, not code. But you must implement the solution on yourown. Submissions are routinely scanned for similarities that occur when students copy and modify otherpeople’s work, or work very closely together on a single implementation. Severe penalties apply to asubmission that is not the original work of the person submitting it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithmics","slug":"Algorithmics","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Algorithmics/"},{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/python/"}]},{"title":"JAVA代写 CS302 program 1","slug":"page1","date":"2016-09-30T07:55:30.000Z","updated":"2016-10-02T15:51:01.939Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/09/30/page1/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/09/30/page1/","excerpt":"","text":"Introduction 此java项目是在week1和2的基础上完成week3，功能不难，不过内容很繁琐时间急，包括了详细的测试，最后提交到网站服务器测试，比较麻烦的是每次提交后得一个小时之后才能继续提交，客户要求时间为6小时，最后开发时间为5小时，其中coding了2小时、服务器测试提交了3次，满分。RequirementP1: Review QuizFor this assignment, you will create a program that will ultimately allow its users to submit and answer multiple choice review questions in preparation for the CS302 Exams. This assignment is organized into three weekly milestones (Week1, Week2, and Week3). At the end of each milestone, you will submit code and receive feedback on your progress through zyLabs. Your learning goals for this assignment include:Incrementally develop a complete Java application from a high-level specification.Design algorithms that account for basic computer input, output, memory, and processing.Iteratively test and debug code throughout the development process.Document code with comments and appropriate styling according to the guides.Build expressions using basic operators: logical, arithmetic, and string-based.Distinguish different types of data, and identify the most appropriate types for all variables.Utilize conditional and looping flow control, both in isolation and in nested structures.Utilize the print and println methods in System.out, to display formatted output.Utilize a single Scanner object to read input from the console.Perform input validation on the user’s input.Your grade for this program includes:Weekly Milestone Progress36% Program compiles and passes the weekly automated tests in zyLabs. Each weekly milestone is includes three automated tests, and each of these tests are each worth 4% of your total program grade.Final Program Functionality44% Program compiles and passes additional automated tests for both functionality and conformance to the program specification. For example, your program should avoid using features that have not yet been covered in previous zyBooks chapters including: Arrays, User-Defined Methods, Additional Classes, Exception Handling, Packages (outside the default), Etc.Style and Structure10% Program uses appropriate variable names, spacing, and control structures in conformance with the CS302 Style Guide, and to make code easier to read.Documentation10% Program is appropriately commented in a way that is meaningful for readers who understand Java, but are not familiar with the logic or purpose of your code. These comments should conform to the CS302 Commenting Guide.Each CS302 student is expected to individually complete this assignment (this is NOT a team assignment). While you are encouraged to discuss general algorithms, and the behavior or syntax for specific java programming constructs, you are NOT allowed to share code for this assignment in any form. All of the code that you submit with this assignment should either be conceived-of and manually typed into the computer by you, or it should be provided for you through this website. AVOID leaving any code in widely accessible places, like: on an unsecured computer or on a widely accessible (non-password protected) website. Remember, all piazza posts that include assignment code or fragments must be marked as private so they are only visible to the poster and the course’s instructional staff.Week1 – Ask Me One QuestionCreate a new Java Project in Eclipse. You can name this project whatever you want, but Program1 is a sensible name. Next download theReviewQuiz.java and P1.jar files (try right-clicking to “Save Link As…” these files). Copy this .java file into the src folder within your new Java project’s folder, and copy this .jar file into your project folder itself (outside of the src folder). You may need to select Refresh from the File menu (or press F5), if you cannot immediately see these files in the Package Explorer within Eclipse. In order to use the provided P1.jar file, you’ll need to right-click on this file within the Package Explorer and select “Add to Build Path…” from the “Build Path” sub menu. Your entire program for this assignment should be implemented within the main method of this ReviewQuiz.java file. Remember to follow the course Style Guide and Commenting Guide as you develop this program. Also remember to regularly test (compile and run) your program as you develop it.As soon as your program begins, it should display the following welcome message:Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!And just before your program ends, it should display the following closing message (both of these messages should include the demonstrated row of equals symbols):Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!After displaying the welcome message, your program should ask the user to enter their email address to identify them as a particular user:Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduNote that the orange text above indicate text that was entered by the user. Although your program will not use this information until the next milestone, your program should read in this email address and store it for later use.Before asking the user a question, you will solicit advice on which sections the user is interested in reviewing. The P1.getSections() method evaluates to a String that includes a list of numbered section names. For example:1 String sectionText P1.getSections();After printing out this list, your code should prompt the user for their choice, read in their integer response, and store it for later use. Note that if adding this P1.getSections() instruction to your code produces an error stating that P1 cannot be resolved, it is likely that the P1.jar file was not correctly added to your project, and you should double check that you correctly followed the instructions in step 0. If all is well, this part of your program should look like the following when it is run:SECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1Note: Your program should only use a single Scanner object to read all user input. Creating and using multiple “new Scanner(System.in)” objects produces behavior that is not defined in the Java specification, could cause trouble for some auto grading tools, and is likely to lose you points on this assignment. So don’t do it :).Next we’ll present the user with their first question. The P1.getQuestion() method should evaluate to a String containing a question for the user. But if you try to retrieve this string before choosing a section that there are questions within, you will see the following error message. Try this out now!Exception in thread “main” java.lang.RuntimeException: No questions were available for the selected sections.This P1.getQuestion() method is stateful, which means that it may evaluate to different String values depending on what code ran before it. In order to get a question from the user’s chosen section, we must first call P1.toggleSection( 1 ); This will cause P1.getQuestion() to resolve as a String containing a question from section 1. You should replace this 1, with an expression that evaluates to the section that was chosen by the user, so they instead see a question from the section that they have chosen. When the user chooses a section that there are no questions for, your program will crash showing the above message (this will be fixed in the last milestone). Otherwise, they should see a question from the section that they previously selected. Note that the provided questions (you will eventually be able to add more questions of your own) are within sections 1 and 2.Update 9/13: The P1.toggleSection method should be called immedaitely after reading in the user’s section choice. If you print anything out to the screen between reading in the user’s choice and calling P1.toggleSection, your code will run into problems with one of the automated milestone1 tests.Now it is time to read in the user’s answer to the previous multiple choice question. This question should always be a letter: usually A, B, C, … but T, F and other single letter answers are possible. After they answer this question, they should see the correct answer displayed on the screen. You can retrieve the correct answer by using the method P1.getAnswer() which returns this answer as a single char. Here is what a complete run of this program might look like at this point (note the expected vertical whitespace in this example):Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1[T]rue or [F]alse: Every variable in java has both a type and a value.Enter your answer: TThe correct answer is: TThank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Review the code that you have written so far, and after you are satisfied that it conforms to the above specifications, submit a copy of your working ReviewQuiz.java code along with this P1.java placeholder file (since we cannot updload jar files) to zyBooks. Note that there should not be any need to add this P1.java to your Eclipse project, and that doing so is likely to create name conflicts with the P1.jar file that you are already using. If the automated tests detect any errors with your code, you can fix your code and resubmit it as many times as you’d like (however, you’ll have to wait 60 minutes between submissions). You will be awarded points based on your submission that earns the most points prior to the due date: 8:00am on Thursday, September 15th.Week2 – As You WishStart by extending your program from Milestone1 to ask the user to enter a new review problem after they answer the question and before the program’s closing message is displayed. Here’s an example of what these new prompts and user-input should look like:Enter a multiple choice question (in one line of text):[T]rue or [F]alse, statements in Java end with a semicolon.Enter the correct answer for this question (one letter): TSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsEnter the section for this problem: 1There are just a couple more steps before this question that the user has answered is added to their local database. First, your code should give the user a chance to proof read their question and either confirm or deny that it should be added.Please proofread your problem and confirm you would like to submit it (Y/N): YThank you for submitting this new problem.A response of Y should result in the feedback demonstrated above, and a call to the method P1.submitProblem() which takes four arguments between the parentheses:1 P1.submitProblem( q, a, s, e );The “q” above should be replaced with the String question entered by the use, the “a” with their char answer as an upper-case letter, the “s” with their int section number, and the “e” with their String email address. After this method is called, the final step required to commit this new question to the local database is to call the method P1.done(). You can call this method once at the end of your program, after the closing message is displayed. It may be helpful to leave this line commented out as you work, to avoid adding extra questions to the database. Otherwise you may find it helpful to occasionally delete the file within your project folder that is named “db” to refresh your local question database to contain only the default provided questions.When the user enters anything other than the letter ‘Y’ (either upper-case or lower-case) in response to the confirmation prompt above, your program should NOT call P1.submitProblem() and instead of displaying the “Thank you for submitting this new problem” response demonstrated above, it should display the following:Problem was NOT submitted.Update 9/16: Note that the zyBooks tests will expect that you have converted the answer letter that was entered by the user into upper-case (if it was entered in lower-case) before calling the P1.submitProblem() method.Next we’ll revisit our question and answer code to provide different feedback based on whether the user’s answer is correct. When they enter the correct answer, your program should print out the following response:That’s correct!!!and when the enter an incorrect answer your program should display the correct answer:The correct answer is: TNote that this is only what the prompt should look like when the correct answer is T, and the user has answered something other than T. Both lower-case and upper-case letter T inputs should be treated as correct.Now let’s give the user a chance to rate the difficulty of the question that they just answered, and to see how difficult others have found this questions. The prompts and user-input for this should look as follows (and should be presented to the user after they have seen whether their answer was correct or not):Please rate the difficulty of this problem (1-easy to 5-hard, or 0-report): 2The average rating for this question has been: 2.25Of course the specific values entered and displayed here may vary. And as you may have guessed by now, there are a couple of provided methods that you can use to submit and check these user ratings: P1.submitRating(2) to submit a rating of 2 (or change this 2 to match the user’s input) and P1.getRating() to retrieve the current question’s average rating (which was 2.25 in the example above).As the final step in this milestone, we’ll add some menu options for the user to choose whether they would like to 1) Answer a Question, 2) Submit a Problem, or 3) Quit the program. The user will enter A, S, or Q to choose between these options, and then only answer a question or submit a new question before seeing the final closing message. When the user chooses to Quit, they should immediately see the closing message. And when the user enters anything other than an A, S, or Q (or a, s, or q), they should see a message stating the following before the program’s closing message and end:Sorry, but that menu choice was not recognized.Here are a couple of sample runs of the program at this point to see everything working together, and also to demonstrate the required spacing (notice that each main menu option is indented by four spaces):Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: aSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a problem from: 1[T]rue or [F]alse: Every variable in java has both a type and a value.Enter your answer: FThe correct answer is: TPlease rate the difficulty of this problem (1-easy to 5-hard, or 0-report): 2The average rating for this question has been: 2.2Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: SEnter a multiple choice question (in one line of text):This is a pretty silly example: A) wrong, B) incorrect, C) correct, D) bad answerEnter the correct answer for this question (one letter): CSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsEnter the section for this problem: 2Please proofread your problem and confirm you would like to submit it (Y/N): yThank you for submitting this new problem.Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: WSorry, but that menu choice was not recognized.Thank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [A]nswer a Question [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: qThank you for using the CS302 Review Quiz!After reviewing your code and convincing yourself that it conforms to the above specifications, submit your ReviewQuiz.java file along with this placeholder P1.java file to zyBooks P1 Milestone2. If the automated tests report any errors, attempt to debug your code and submit it again. You are allowed one feedback submission per hour. Your results on these tests will be recorded for points at 8:00am on Thursday, September 22nd.Notice that we have not added very much code to handle unexpected user input. Giving the user another chance to enter a number instead of crashing when the user types in two to select section 2 would be nice. It might also be nice to ensure that they only select section numbers that are within the correct range. Another possibility would be ensure that the email address entered by the user actually conforms to the format of a proper email address. For this programming assignment, we will not be testing your program against these kinds of erroneous inputs. However we certainly encourage you to think about how you could change you code to better deal with these kinds of potential problems. If you would like to try implementing some of these types of changes, please make a separate copy of your work to experiment with. This should help us avoid unanticipated problems that our automated grading tools might encounter with these kinds of customizations.Week3 – More, More, MoreOur Milestone2 ReviewQuiz.java program currently only presents the user with one question when it is run, so we’ll start this section by extending that functionality to present the user with multiple questions. Replace the “[A]nswer a Question” option in your program’s main menu with these two new options: [R]andom Sample Quiz (fixed number of problems) [P]roficiency Quiz (fixed number of correct answers)After selecting either of these options, the user will be asked to choose a section to be asked questions from, and will then be repeatedly: presented with a question, given feedback on it’s correct answer, and then prompted to rate that question and be shown it’s current rating (based on the code you wrote in milestone2).The “[R]andom Sample Quiz” option will ask the user a fixed number of questions. This number is specified by the user in response to the following prompt, which should be displayed after the section selection, and before the first question is asked:Enter the number of problems to review: 3The “[P]roficiency Quiz” option will instead ask the user as many questions as it takes for them to answer a specific number of those questions correctly. The number of correct answers that will end the program will be input using the following prompt (again, between the section selection and first question):Enter the number of correct answers needed to stop: 2Note that every time you call the P1.getQuestion(), P1.getAnswer(), and P1.getRating() methods, you retrieve the current question, answer, and rating. Each time you call the method P1.gotoNextProblem(), these other methods will retrieve the question, answer, and rating for a different problem, so it will be helpful to call this between questions.You should also display an increasing problem number in front of each question, so that the output of your program matches the following:Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [R]andom Sample Quiz (fixed number of problems) [P]roficiency Quiz (fixed number of correct answers) [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: rSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose a section to answer a question from: 1Enter the number of problems to review: 31.

Update the section selection code to present the user with multiple prompts until they enter -1 and have selected sections with at least one question in the database. There is a method called P1.questionsAvailable() that evaluates to true when the selected sections contain at least one question. Only call this method when the user enters -1 to determine whether that input should end the section selection loop. Also notice that the P1.getSections() methods already displays selected sections with square brackets around them. Here’s an example of the prompts and inputs:Welcome to the CS302 Review Quiz!Please enter your email address: jane.doe@wisc.eduMAIN MENU [R]andom Sample Quiz (fixed number of problems) [P]roficiency Quiz (fixed number of correct answers) [S]ubmit a Problem [Q]uitEnter your choice: pSECTIONS: 1.The Basics, 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose another section to answer problems from (or -1 to stop): 1SECTIONS: [1.The Basics], 2.Conditionals, 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose another section to answer problems from (or -1 to stop): 2SECTIONS: [1.The Basics], [2.Conditionals], 3.Loops, 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose another section to answer problems from (or -1 to stop): 3SECTIONS: [1.The Basics], [2.Conditionals], [3.Loops], 4.Arrays, 5.User-Defined Methods, 6.More Methods / Arrays, 7.Multi-D Arrays, 8.Using Objects, 9.Creating Classes, 10.OO Design, 11.Inheritance, 12.Exceptions, 13.File IO, 14.AbstractsChoose another section to answer problems from (or -1 to stop): -1Enter the number of correct answers needed to stop: 11.

This will allow the user to take as many quizzes and submit as many problems as they’d like within a single execution of the program. Note that when multiple quizzes are taken in a single execution, the default section selection from one quiz will persist as the default selection for the next quiz. Thisis the expected behavior for your program, so you don’t need to worry about tracking or clearing these old selections.
