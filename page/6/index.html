The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time<br>to prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may include<br>extra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.<br>Test Case  Expected Result  Actual Result<br>The user selects to purchase Tier 1<br>tickets.<br>The user is prompted to<br>enter the number of<br>tickets to purchase.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 3 of 9<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>Using the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticket<br>sales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing the<br>requirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects an<br>option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised and<br>shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter the<br>Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they are<br>returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additional<br>tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but a<br>purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2<br>ticket costs $11.25.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 tickets<br>sold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just update<br>the date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number of<br>days until the games commence.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1<br>and Tier 2 tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

A full file header for your README is not needed, but you still need to<br>put your name and cs11f login at the top. However, all other style guidelines apply to all the files ( e.g. over 80<br>characters apply to READMEs as well. )<br>You will be specifically graded on commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names,<br>sufficient use of blank lines, not using more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-<br>coded numbers other than zero and +/-1, and use of accessor/mutator methods to access private fields (getters and<br>setters) where specified.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>You are asked to create an interactive 3 x 3 puzzle game for pre-schoolers. The player has to drag the puzzle pieces on<br>the right to the correct location on the left to form a complete image. This assignment does NOT involve ActiveObjects<br>or require a paint() method. The correctness of this assignment is based on meeting the required functionalities listed<br>below.<br>Part 0: Overview  BoardPieces  PuzzlePieces<br>We have a 3 x 3 puzzle, which gives us 9 puzzle pieces that are movable on the right. They can be dragged<br>anywhere on the canvas, but not off the canvas. On the left, we have a 3 x 3 board. After a puzzle piece is dragged<br>onto its correct location, the puzzle piece is “locked” into the board and is no longer movable.<br>The reason “locked” is in quotes is because the puzzle piece is actually not locked. We created this illusion by<br>having two different types of Pieces here: PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece. When a PuzzlePiece (movable piece on the<br>right) is dragged onto a BoardPiece (fixed piece on the left), your program will do some verification to see if they<br>match. If so, it’s going to hide the PuzzlePiece and reveal the BoardPiece with the same image as the PuzzlePiece.<br>So it may seem like the PuzzlePiece is locked in place, but it’s actually a different BoardPiece that’s displayed on<br>the canvas. Now that we know the basic idea/hack behind this game, how do we implement it?<br>Part 1: Useful Interfaces<br>Take advantage of interfaces! We have two different kinds of Piece types here, but they share a lot in common.<br>We’ll implement the Piece interface later in PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece classes.<br>1. The Highlightable interface is used to draw borders and highlights around each piece:<br>import java.awt.Color;<br>public interface Highlightable {<br>public abstract void showHighlight( Color color );<br>public abstract void hideHighlight();<br>}<br>2. The Hideable interface is used to hide and show pieces:<br>public interface Hideable {<br>public abstract void show();<br>public abstract void hide();<br>}<br>3. The Piece interface, which extends the two interfaces above and includes a few other methods:<br>import objectdraw.<em>;<br>public interface Piece extends Highlightable, Hideable {<br>public abstract boolean contains(Location point);<br>public abstract boolean equals(Object o);<br>public abstract Location getCenter();<br>public abstract int getId();<br>public abstract void move(double dx, double dy);<br>}<br>Part 2: Piece Classes<br>You will create 2 Piece classes: class BoardPiece and class PuzzlePiece.<br>Each of these classes will implement the Piece interface. For example:<br>public class BoardPiece implements Piece { … }<br>Each Piece class will hold the specifics about that piece:<br>•  the piece image (a VisibleImage created from passing an Image object to its constructor)<br>•  ID (integer indexed from 0 to 8 in order of left to right and top to bottom, each ID represents a piece with<br>a distinct image)<br>•  center (a Location object that represents the center point of this piece)<br>•  borders/highlights (PuzzlePiece (the movable pieces on the right) has one black FramedRect object right<br>on top of the edge of the image and wraps around it as the border. BoardPiece (the fixed pieces on the<br>left) has two FramedRect objects, one right on top of the edge of the image, and one that’s inset by 1px,<br>so it creates a thicker outline. When the game first starts, BoardPiece should only display the outer<br>highlight as black.)<br>Thus, the constructor for BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece should be identical. For example:<br>public BoardPiece(Image img, int id, Location loc, DrawingCanvas canvas) { … }<br>Each Piece class will also implement the methods from the Piece interface.<br>•  showHighlight() and hideHighlight() can access and change the visibility of the FramedRect objects that<br>highlight each piece.<br>•  show() in PuzzlePiece should show the image and the black FramedRect highlight. show() in BoardPiece<br>should just show the image. We will call showHighlight() when we want to display the green highlight to<br>indicate the puzzle piece is in the correct spot on the board (more on this later).<br>•  hide() in PuzzlePiece should hide the image and the highlight. hide() in BoardPiece does nothing unless<br>you plan to implement the extra credit.<br>•  contains() in PuzzlePiece determines whether some point is contained in the VisibleImage associated with<br>that piece (Hint: use VisibleImage’s contains() method). contains() method in BoardPiece requires a little<br>more logic. If you are giving this puzzle to someone, you don’t want him/her to solve this so quickly by just<br>dragging the PuzzlePieces close enough to the BoardPieces so they get locked in automatically. If you are<br>the player, you also don’t want to be forced to drag the PuzzlePiece so your cursor/PuzzlePiece falls<br>perfectly within the BoardPiece. So what we are going to do here is add a different check: instead of<br>passing the point where the cursor is, we are going to pass the center of the PuzzlePiece we are dragging<br>to contains(). If the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the<br>BoardPiece, then we can say “the point is contained” in the BoardPiece. What we are really checking here<br>is whether the center of the PuzzlePiece is contained in the 50 x 50px square in the BoardPiece.<br>•  equals() checks if two Pieces are equal (for example, does the PuzzlePiece match with the BoardPiece in<br>the board grid?). This is done by checking the unique ID (0 - 8) we assigned to each piece.<br>•  getId() returns the unique ID of the Piece.<br>•  getCenter() returns the center of the Piece.<br>•  move() in BoardPiece should do nothing since BoardPieces are fixed. You would have to add some<br>implementation if you decide to do extra credit. move() in PuzzlePiece is in charge of moving the<br>PuzzlePiece around. There’s one tricky thing about this method… you need to make sure that the<br>PuzzlePieces cannot be dragged off the canvas. More specifically, the center of PuzzlePiece should not be<br>able to move off the canvas.<br>Part 3: class Puzzle<br>Now we’ve set up the building blocks for this game, we can start implementing the controller Puzzle class. Class<br>Puzzle should extend WindowController and include main() that starts a new instance of Acme.MainFrame. The<br>canvas size should be 735 by 380 pixels.<br>Part 3a: Get Images<br>Nine 100px x 100px puzzle piece images are available for you in ~/../public/PA5-images/. They are numbered<br>from p0 to p8 (e.g. p0.jpg, p1.jpg, …).<br>In order to load these images into the program, use the getImage() method in class Puzzle (the main GUI controller<br>that implements WindowController). For example:<br>getImage(“p0.jpg”);<br>We need to load 9 images into an Image array (array of Image objects). Instead of hardcoding 9 lines of<br>getImage(), we can do this in a loop using some string concatenation. getImage() will return an Image object. You<br>should pass each Image object as an actual argument to each the of Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, and inside<br>that Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, make a VisibleImage object based on the Image object.<br>Part 3b: Layout<br>The main Puzzle class will also layout the BoardPieces and the PuzzlePieces as seen in the earlier screenshots.<br>Again, instead of hardcoding 18 different locations, we are going to use two arrays to store Locations, one for<br>BoardPieces and one for PuzzlePieces. The good news is that the constants and the formulas of calculating these<br>Locations have been worked out for you:<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_COL = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_ROW = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PUZZLE_SPACING = 20; // num of px between PuzzlePieces<br>private static final int PUZZLE_OFFSET = 355; // offset from left side of canvas<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_X = 25; // left margin of the board<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_Y = 40; // top margin of the board<br>private static final int SIDE_LENGTH = 100; // side length of each Piece<br>BoardPiece with index i is located at<br>x = BOARD_MARGIN_X + SIDE_LENGTH </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = BOARD_MARGIN_Y + SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>PuzzlePiece with index i is located at<br>x = PUZZLE_OFFSET + PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL + 1)<br>+ SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW + 1) + SIDE_LENGTH * (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>These x and y coordinates represent the upper left corners of the VisibleImage in each Piece. You can check the<br>math if you are curious what’s up with all these mods and divides.<br>Before you place all the Pieces onto the canvas, add a Text object as the winning message “YOU WON!” at x = 355<br>and y = the Y value of the fourth BoardPiece. It should have font size of 55 in bold and green. Hide the winning<br>message for now, and we will come back to it later (the order of creation matters here because it affects the<br>drawing arrangement).<br>Now let’s put the Pieces onto the canvas. Placing the BoardPieces is easy. We already have the Image array and<br>the Location array for BoardPieces. We just need another array of the interface type Piece to keep track of the<br>BoardPieces. We will go through the Image array and the Location array and create BoardPieces in order. Each<br>BoardPiece ID should match with its index in the Piece array.<br>For PuzzlePieces though, we want to pick one of the nine images randomly. We can do so by implementing a<br>method called getRandomPuzzlePiece() that takes in Location and DrawingCanvas. This method will use a<br>RandomIntGenerator that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 8. We will first check if this randomly<br>generated index represents an image that’s already used. If so, we want to get another random index until we find<br>an unused one, because every PuzzlePiece should have a unique image. Once we’ve found an unused index, we<br>can create a new PuzzlePiece. We are going to return this Piece we randomly created and store a reference to it in<br>a Piece array. We’ll do this 9 times to place all the PuzzlePieces. Note that the ID in PuzzlePiece is NOT associated<br>with its random array index but with the unique piece image.<br>To avoid using magic numbers like 8, you can create a MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES constant. In our case,<br>MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES is 9. When we need to use this as an index, we can do MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES – 1, which<br>takes care of the offset from zero-based indexing.<br>Hooray! Now you should be able to see all the BoardPieces and PuzzlePieces on your canvas. But we are not quite<br>there yet. Your GUI controller (class Puzzle) needs to handle all the mouse events and the logic of verifying the<br>Pieces. Take a break before you proceed. :)<br>Part 3c: Dragging PuzzlePiece<br>By PA5, you should be pretty familiar with onMousePress(), onMouseDrag(), and onMouseRelease(). The logic is<br>still the same. You want to keep a reference to lastPoint and find the difference between lastPoint and current<br>point. You do need to do one additional thing here, and that is keep track of which PuzzlePiece is being grabbed.<br>You can do so by looping through the Piece array holding all the PuzzlePieces and find which PuzzlePiece contains<br>the point.<br>Part 3d: Verifying PuzzlePiece<br>Hmmm… Where should you be checking if the puzzle piece has been placed (not while still dragging) in the correct<br>spot on the board to the left? There’s only one place, and I’ll let you answer it (HINT: it is NOT in onMouseDrag()).<br>But I’ll walk you through how to verify a puzzle piece has been placed correctly. Remember many words ago, we<br>said if the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the BoardPiece, we can say<br>the PuzzlePiece is “contained” in the BoardPiece (this check is already done in contains()). Here, the methods<br>you’ve implemented in BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece come in handy. You can use getCenter() to get the center of<br>the grabbed puzzle piece and call contains() on every BoardPiece in a loop. If we were able to find a BoardPiece<br>that contains the center of the grabbed puzzle piece AND they are equal (matching IDs), then we can go ahead and<br>“lock” this Piece. Again, the “locking”<br>is done by hiding the grabbed puzzle<br>piece and showing the BoardPiece as<br>described in the overview. Don’t<br>forget to show green highlights<br>around the BoardPiece to let the pre-<br>schoolers know that they’ve placed<br>the Piece correctly!<br>Part 3e: Verifying Victory<br>Almost there… I can hear the sound of victory! How can we check if the puzzle is finished? One easy way to do this<br>is having yet another array. This array will contain booleans that represent whether a Piece has been “locked”.<br>Since the Pieces have unique IDs from 0 to 8, we can just use those as indices and mark them true as they get<br>“locked”. The game is done after every element in this boolean array becomes true. At the moment of victory, you<br>should hide the green highlights around each BoardPiece and display a seamless image composed of 9 pieces. You<br>should also show the winning message.<br>And yaaaaaay, that’s the end of this assignment.<br>Running<br>To compile your Puzzle game, type this into the terminal:<br>&gt; javac -cp ./Acme.jar:./objectdraw.jar:.

A boolean circuit is a logical formula<br>consisting of boolean variables a,b,x,y,···, negation (NOT, written as !), con-<br>junction (AND, written as ∧) and disjunction (OR, written as ∨). For example,<br>(a ∧ b) ∨ (c ∨ !(b)) is a boolean circuit on variables a,b and c. The truth value<br>of a boolean circuit is either true or false, and it can be determined when-<br>ever the truth values of all variables of the circuit are fixed. For example, if<br>a = true,b = false and c = true, the truth value of the boolean circuit above<br>is true. An assignment of truth values to the boolean variables of a circuit is<br>called a truth assignment for that circuit.<br>Two circuits are equivalent iff they have the same truth value for all possible<br>truth assignments of their variables. For example, the circuit a ∧ a is equivalent<br>to the circuit a, and the circuit !(a∨b) is equivalent to the circuit !(a)∧!(b). The<br>circuit a∧b is not equivalent to the circuit a∨b, since, for instance, if a = false<br>and b = true, the truth value of the first circuit is false, and the truth value of<br>the second circuit is true.<br>The free variables of a circuit are the variables used in that circuit (without<br>repetitions). For example, the free variables of the circuit (x ∧ y) ∨ !(x) are x<br>and y.<br>The task<br>In this assignment, you are given two classes, Assignment.java and Circuit.java,<br>and they are already implemented for you.

How can you do your assignment when half of it is gibberish!? You didn’t ask for a task<br>descryption! As you are thinking this, something suddenly occurs to you. You are a Java programmer now!<br>You have all the skills you need to crack this silly cipher, and you’re going to do it!<br>Before You Begin<br>Remember that this task is here to help you improve your programming skills. When doing this task, you<br>might find some parts tricky, but this is normal and also a good thing (if we were never challenged, we would<br>never learn anything!). The most important things are to start this task as soon as you can, to ask questions<br>when you need help and to be persistent! It’s often good to work on one part of the assignment at a time, then<br>submit to PASTA to see how you went with it. Try to be creative when approaching problems - usually there<br>are many ways to do something. We hope you enjoy this cryptography-themed task! :)<br>Part 1 – Your Own Secret Messages<br>In the first part of this assignment, your task is to write a program to encrypt and decrypt your very own secret<br>messages using a substitution cipher! This substitution cipher will involve swapping each letter of the alphabet<br>with a different letter and sometimes also removing spaces. For example, maybe “a” might be replaced with<br>“e”, “b” might be replaced with “a”, “c” might be replaced with “f” and so on.<br>In order to encrypt and decrypt these kinds of messages, the sender and receiver must both know a secret key.<br>A key is a set of rules that tell you which letters to swap with which. One way that you can represent this key<br>is with a string that contains all of the letters from a to z exactly once. The first letter in the string should be<br>the letter that replaces “a” when encrypting, the second letter in the string should be the letter that replaces<br>“b”, the third letter should be the one that replaces “c” etc.<br>For example, if the string is “bzcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxya”, then “a” would be replaced with “b”, “b” would<br>be replaced with “z”, “z” would be replaced with “a” and everything else would stay the same. So, a word like<br>“zebra” would become “aezrb”.<br>When decrypting, the reverse would be done: “b” would be replaced with “a”, “z” would be replaced with<br>“b”, “a” would be replaced with “z” and everything else would stay the same. So, “aezrb” would become<br>“zebra”.<br>All right, with that in mind, are you ready to make your own secret messages?<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>3<br>Step 1 ‐ Getting the skeleton code<br>In this task description, there is a section called Setting Up. Please read this section carefully for information<br>about the skeleton code and follow the instructions to set up your workspace.<br>Step 2 – Understanding the Encrypter class<br>For this part of the assignment (i.e. Part 1), we will be focusing on only two of the three skeleton code classes:<br>Encrypter and SecretMessages. You could think of the Encrypter class as a set of instructions for<br>making encrypters. That is, things that can encrypt and decrypt secret messages. Each encrypter has its own<br>special key for encrypting and decrypting messages, and also a setting for removing whitespace. (Recall that<br>in programming, all characters that are not visible when displayed are called collectively whitespace. Thus,<br>the whitespace includes the normal space “ ” but also the tab “\t”, new line “\n” and some other characters.)<br>This option to remove whitespace is useful, because messages without<br>spaces are harder to guess. For example, it might be easy to guess that<br>something like “T od Dto” by looking at word length, but “TodDto”<br>would be harder!<br>Sometimes you might not want to remove whitespace, though,<br>because then it’s more difficult to read the message after decrypting<br>it. For example, “IamMia” is more difficult to read than “I am Mia”.<br>Perhaps when testing your code, it would be nicer if the decryption<br>was very easy to read. So, in some cases, not removing whitespace<br>could be helpful.<br>This is why each encrypter has a removeSpaces setting. If removeSpaces is set to true, then the encrypter<br>will remove all whitespace when encrypting. If it is set to false, then the encrypter will not remove whitespace.<br>Note that the encrypter should never remove whitespace when decrypting, as this just makes the message<br>unnecessarily difficult to read.<br>Step 3 – Writing the Encrypter Class<br>You are welcome to complete this task in any order you like, but if you’re not sure where to begin, try starting<br>with the getKey and isRemovingSpaces methods in the Encrypter class.<br>The blue comments above each method tell you exactly what the method should do, and give you information<br>about input and output. Please read this carefully!<br>After you have written a method, it’s a good idea to check that it works correctly. You can do this by submitting<br>your code to PASTA. Even if you have only written one method, you can still submit your code. Remember<br>that you are allowed as many attempts as you like, so there really is no harm in doing this. To submit your<br>code, first make sure your code compiles (i.e. no red errors in Eclipse), then follow the submission instructions<br>at the end of this task description.<br>If anything seems unfamiliar, try looking at the lecture slides, tutorial questions and textbook sections on<br>object oriented design. Also, here are a few hints that you might find useful when completing these methods!<br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>4<br>Hint 1 If you have a character and want to check if it is a letter or whitespace, you can use the Character<br>methods isWhitespace and isLetter.<br>Here’s an example of how you could check if the character ‘T’ is a letter:<br>if (Character.isLetter(‘T’))<br>System.out.println(“This is a letter”);<br>Hint 2 You can easily check if a letter character is lowercase or uppercase using the following Character<br>methods: isUpperCase, isLowerCase.<br>Here is an example of how you could check if the character ‘B’ is uppercase:<br>if (Character.isUpperCase(‘B’))<br>System.out.println(“This character is an uppercase letter!”);<br>Hint 3 Want to get the lowercase equivalent of an uppercase letter, or the uppercase equivalent of a<br>lowercase letter? Well then, these Character methods are just what you need: toUpperCase,<br>toLowerCase<br>Here’s an example of how you could get ‘B’ in lowercase:<br>char lowercaseB = Character.toLowerCase(‘B’); //lowercaseB will be ‘b’<br>Hint 4 Say you have a character which is a lowercase letter, and you want to know its position in the<br>alphabet. For example, ‘a’ is in position 0, ‘b’ is in position 1, ‘c’ is in position 2 etc.<br>Here’s a simple way you can do it (note that charName is the name of the character you’re interested<br>in).<br>int position = charName - ‘a’;<br>How does this work? Well, charName and ‘a’ are converted to certain integers. ‘a’ is converted to<br>97,  ‘b’  is  converted  to  98,  ‘c’  to  99  etc.  (see  this  table  for  reference<br><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html</a> ). Then, these integers are<br>subtracted.<br>So, something like ‘c’ – ‘a’ becomes 99 – 97, which is 2. Ah! And 2 is the position of ‘c’ in the<br>alphabet. :D.<br>To find the position of an uppercase letter, just convert it to lowercase first and follow the same<br>process!<br>Hint 5 What about going backwards? What if you know the position of a letter in the alphabet and you<br>want to know what character it is? Well, we can do something similar to before!<br>Here’s how we could find the character in position 4 of the alphabet:<br>int character = (char) (4 + ‘a’); //character will be e<br>Why is this e? Well, ‘a’ is converted to 97, so we have 4+97, which is 101. Then, we convert 101<br>to a character and get ‘e’.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>5<br>Step 4 – SecretMessages Class<br>Now that we’ve made our Encrypter class, it’s time to use it!<br>Write a program in the class SecretMessages that creates an encrypter and allows the user to do various<br>things with this encrypter.<br>This encrypter should initially:<br> use the key  “zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy”  to encrypt and decrypt messages<br> be set to not remove spaces<br>The program should give the user 5 different choices of things to do with the encrypter:<br>1. encrypt a message<br>2. decrypt a message<br>3. check the key<br>4. change the key<br>5. change the space-removal mode.<br>After the user has made a choice, the program should use the encrypter to perform their choice. Then, it should<br>allow them to make another choice and it should perform that action. It should keep allowing the user to make<br>choices until they decide to quit. See the next section for some examples.<br>Example Input/Output<br>The following are some examples of input/output.

Goodbye.<br><br>INFO1103 Introduction to Programming, Semester 2, 2016<br>7<br>Part 2 – Descryption Decryption<br>In the last section, you made your own encrypter to encrypt and decrypt your own secret messages. This<br>worked by swapping letters around. You also saw that you could remove spaces to make those messages more<br>difficult to decrypt. Of course, if you wanted to go a step further, you could also remove capitalisation and<br>punctuation. This would leave just a big block of letters.<br>If someone handed you a long block of letters like that and you had to decrypt the message without the key,<br>what would you do? It might seem like a difficult task, but we can use a special trick!<br>Say you read a text in plain English, and found that the most common letter was “e”. Then, you read an<br>encrypted message and found that the most common letter was “z”. Would you be able to guess what that “z”<br>actually was? Probably! If the most common letter in English was ‘e’, then there would be good evidence to<br>think that that “z” was actually an “e”!<br>You could do something similar with the rest of the letters! You could get a list of all the letters in English<br>ranked based on how frequently they occur and a list of all letters in the encrypted message ranked in the same<br>way. Then you could try to match up the letters in the lists to guess the key!<br>Of course, this might not always work out exactly. For example, it might be tricky trying to decrypt a novel<br>with no e’s in it! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel" target="_blank" rel="external">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel</a>) ). However, it can be useful in giving you a<br>general idea of which letter could be which, and you could try out different combinations! Generally, the<br>longer the encrypted message, the better this method will work.<br>With all of this in mind, it’s time to finally discover what the encrypted part of the task description says!<br>The encrypted message is quite short, which means that the distribution of letters not exactly the same as<br>general English. So, to make things a little simpler, we are providing a reference text to use. If you count the<br>number of times each letter appears in the reference text, and sort the letters based on how often they appear,<br>the list will be the same as the encrypted text.<br>A reference text of standard English<br>This is some sample text to use as a reference. Have you heard of quokkas? They’re really<br>cute Australian animals that seem like little roos with big puffy cheeks! If you want to<br>see one, the best way is to fly to Perth, then catch a ferry over to Rottness<em> island.<br>There are apparently about 10,000 on Rottness</em> island. Wow! Sometimes, if you have superb<br>selfie skills, you can take a selfie with them! They often look like they’re smiling,<br>which makes them very photogenic! Tortoises are also very q-ute. They have shells, you<br>see. Tortoises might eat juicy fish. Did you hear fish is ‘poisson’ in French? Tortoises<br>are better than fish. Juice is tastier than wine. Is juice a good prize?<br>Nnnnnooooooooooooo! This sentence is still strange. quip, quid, quiz, quote, quit. Good<br>dogs/ pups meet bugs under beds. Ponds. Pepper.

The goal is<br>to build a hand of cards that values as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. First,<br>here is the terminology used in the game.<br> Hit: Take another card for your hand<br> Stand: Stop taking cards<br> Bust: Exceed a value of 21 in your hand<br> Push: Tie with the dealer<br>The cards are valued as follows.<br>Rank Value<br>Ace 11 or 1<br>2–10 Face value<br>Jack, Queen, King 10<br>Of particular note, an Ace can be considered either value 11 or 1. Given rational strategy,<br>it will be considered 11 unless that will cause a bust, in which case it will be considered 1.<br>In each hand, play proceeds as follows.<br>1. The dealer takes one card, which the player can see.<br>2. The player is given two cards.<br>3. The player has the option to hit, or take one additional card. The player can hit as<br>many times as desired, until they reach or exceed 21, or decide to stand (stop taking<br>cards).<br>1<br>4. If the player did not bust (exceed 21), the dealer takes cards until she reaches 17 or<br>higher (i.e., the dealer will hit on 16 or fewer points, and stand on 17 or more points).<br>5. If the player busts, she immediately loses, and the dealer will not draw more cards.<br>If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player and dealer have the same total, it is<br>a push. Otherwise, the winner is the one with higher point total.<br>6. If the player loses, she loses her bet. If the player wins, she wins her bet. If the hand<br>is a push, the bet is returned (i.e., no gain or loss).<br>In this project, you will program a functional Blackjack game by first coding the basic logic<br>of the game, then gradually adding features.<br>2<br>Lab Session 1, Feb 24–Feb 25<br>Activity 1<br>In this activity, you will code the logic of the game using simplifications, rather than tackling<br>a full Blackjack game all at once. Instead of selecting a card and then determining its value,<br>you will instead randomly generate a card’s value from between 2 and 11. You will also<br>assume that the bet is always $25.<br>Note that randomly generating a card’s value is not an accurate way to simulate draws. In a<br>real deck, there are more cards worth 10 than there are, e.g., cards worth 5. Consider other<br>ways in which this version of Blackjack will not be exactly the same as real-life Blackjack.<br>You will add features to make the game more realistic in later activities.<br>1. Write a main() function that asks the user for their name, and initializes their starting<br>money to $1,000.<br>2. Write a loop in main() that will play a hand of blackjack, then ask the user if they want<br>to play another hand (as long as they still have money to bet). You will play a hand<br>by calling the play_hand(name) function (which does not yet exist). This function<br>should return the change in the player’s money (positive if they win, negative if they<br>lose), and you should use this value to update their amount after each hand.<br>3. Write the play_hand(name) function. In this function, you will need to track the<br>running total of the cards that the dealer and player have been dealt. Deal one card<br>to the dealer and two to the player. Prompt the player for their action (hit/stay)<br>until they reach or exceed 21, or choose to stay. Then, deal cards to the dealer until<br>they reach or exceed 17. Determine the winner, and return the change in the player’s<br>money (i.e., 25 if they won, -25 if they lost, and 0 if the hand was a push).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received card of value 2<br>Bill received card of value 9<br>Bill received card of value 5<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 14<br>Move?

(y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>5<br>Activity 2<br>In this activity, you will improve the drawing of cards. You will use the strategy we’ve<br>learned in lecture for encoding information in a way that the computer can store it: trans-<br>form the information into a number. In this activity, use an integer to store each card, and<br>represent them as follows.<br>Rank int encoding Point value<br>Ace (A) 1 11<br>2 2 2<br>3 3 3<br>4 4 4<br>5 5 5<br>6 6 6<br>7 7 7<br>8 8 8<br>9 9 9<br>10 10 10<br>Jack (J) 11 10<br>Queen (Q) 12 10<br>King (K) 13 10<br>Now, you can randomly generate a card from Ace to King, rather than randomly generating<br>a value. You will modify your program so that you can determine how to display each card,<br>as well as what value it has.<br>1. Write a function value_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above (i.e., an int value from 1 to 13) and returns its point value as<br>described above.<br>2. Write a function string_of_card(card) that takes as a parameter an int-encoded<br>card as described above and returns the card’s string value for printing during the<br>game.<br>For example, string_of_card(5) should return “5”, and string_of_card(12) (a<br>Queen) should return “Q”.<br>3. Modify the play_hand function to generate a random card, rather than a random card<br>value. When adding a card to the player or dealer’s total, use value_of_card(card),<br>and when displaying a card, use string_of_card(card).<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>6<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Dealer received 2<br>Bill received A<br>Bill received K<br>Dealer total: 2<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received A<br>Dealer total: 13<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer received 9<br>Dealer total: 22<br>Bill total: 21<br>Dealer bust<br>Bill has $1,025<br>Play again?

(y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>7<br>Lab Session 2, Mar 2–Mar 3<br>Activity 3<br>In this activity, you will save the player’s game and allow them to resume. You will use file<br>I/O as discussed in lecture. You will save and restore the player’s name and money total.<br>1. Write a function save(name, money) that saves the user’s name and money to the<br>file blackjack.save.<br>Hint: In order to restore this information successfully, you should save these two<br>pieces of information on separate lines of the file.<br>2. Write a function restore() that attempts to read the user’s name and money from<br>the file blackjack.save. If it is successful, it should return these values as a string and<br>an int, respectively. If it fails, it should return ‘’, -1 to indicate it was unsuccessful.<br>3. Modify function main() to call save(name, money) before quitting.<br>4. Modify function main() to call restore() when starting up. If the load was successful,<br>ask the user if they would like to resume or start a new game. If it was unsuccessful,<br>simply start a new game.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage (nothing has changed yet, because there<br>is no saved game to load):<br>Name?

(y/n) n<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>10<br>Activity 4<br>In this activity, you will allow the player to change their bet before each hand.<br>1. Write a function input_bet(bet, money) that accepts parameter for the current bet<br>and amount of money available, and returns the bet input from the user. Perform<br>input validation on the following requirements:<br>The bet must be a whole number, cannot be negative, and cannot be greater than the<br>available money. If the user presses enter without typing anything, use the existing<br>bet value (if valid). The user can bet 0, which means they want to quit the game.<br>2. Modify main() to call input_bet(bet, money) before every hand instead of prompt-<br>ing for y/n for another hand. If the user bets 0, save their game and quit.<br>Now, you will need to pass the current bet to the play_hand function, and modify<br>this function so it returns the correct change in the player’s money when they win or<br>lose.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 1500<br>Cannot bet more than $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) Fifty<br>Bet?

(hit/stay) h<br>Bill received A<br>Dealer total: 11<br>Bill total: 26<br>Bill bust<br>Bill has $0<br>Game over<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>12<br>Lab Session 3, Mar 16–Mar 17<br>Activity 5<br>In this activity, you will improve the card drawing functionality even further. In real life,<br>you cannot draw 5 Aces in a single hand. However, if we’re only generating random cards,<br>this is possible. Therefore, for each hand, you will create a deck of cards, shuffle it, and<br>draw from it.<br>1. Write a function new_deck() that returns a list containing 4 Kings, 4 Queens, etc.<br>using the integer encoding from Activity 2.<br>Hint: Use nested loops.<br>2. Write a function shuffle_deck(deck) that returns a shuffled version of the deck.<br>Hint: Use the random module.<br>3. Modify play_hand() so that it creates and shuffles a deck at the start of each hand.<br>Instead of randomly generating cards, “draw” them from the shuffled deck. Be sure<br>that you do not draw the same card from the deck multiple times (e.g., by removing<br>the card you draw from the deck).<br>Unless you know how to count cards, the output after this activity will not look very<br>different. However, your distribution of cards will be more realistic. You should run your<br>program to ensure that you are still getting random-looking cards, and not drawing the<br>same cards over and over again.<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>13<br>Activity 6<br>In this activity, you will modify your encoding of cards so that it stores both the rank (A–K)<br>and the suit (♣, ♦, ♥, ♠).<br>1. Modify new_deck() so that it creates a list of cards where each card is a tuple of size<br>2. Store the int value first, then a string value representing the suit.<br>Hint: You may be able to copy and paste the suit symbols directly into your text<br>editor. If not, you can use the following escape sequences to include the suit symbols<br>in a string literal in Python.<br>Suit Escape sequence<br>♣ \u2663<br>♦ \u2662<br>♥ \u2661<br>♠ \u2660<br>2. Modify value_of_card to account for the change in encoding of cards.<br>3. Modify the string_of_card to print both the rank and suit of the card.<br>Here is an example run after completing this stage:<br>Name? Bill<br>Bill has $1,000<br>Bet? (0 to quit, Enter to stay at $25) 100<br>Dealer received 10♦<br>Bill received 6♦<br>Bill received 2♠<br>Dealer total: 10<br>Bill total: 8<br>Move?

(0 to quit, Enter to stay at $100) 0<br>Once you have completed these steps, show your TA your program.<br>15<br>Lab Session 4, Mar 23–Mar 24<br>Activity 7<br>In this activity, you will modify your program to improve its output. Instead of keeping<br>track of only the total points of the player and dealer, you will keep track of their full hand<br>as a list of cards.<br>1. Write function string_of_hand(hand) that uses the string_of_card(card) func-<br>tion to return a string of an entire hand (encoded as a list of cards).<br>2. Write function value_of_hand(hand) that uses the value_of_card(card) function<br>to return the value of an entire hand of cards.<br>3. Modify the function play_hand so that it keeps track of the hands of the player and<br>dealer, rather than just the total points for their hand. Then modify your output so<br>that it prints the hands instead of individual cards.<br>4. Modify your function value_of_hand(hand) so that it correctly adds the value of<br>Ace.<br>Recall the rule: if an Ace of value 11 would make the hand bust, it is considered to<br>be value 1 instead.

Links will be provided on the eLP for<br>electronic submission of your work.<br>Marking and feedback will be available within the following 3 weeks in class<br>or via an appointment, or via e-mail.<br>Weighting towards Module 70%<br>Learning Objectives Covered The following learning objectives are either<br>fully or partially covered by this assignment:<br>1. Analyse and specify a programming problem.<br>2. Design a high-level solution to the problem using object oriented and<br>general imperative programming language constructs.<br>3. Write, compile, execute, test and debug an OO program, which maps the<br>high-level design onto concrete programming constructs, using appropriate<br>documentation standards and software tools.<br>4. Critically evaluate the methodologies and conceptual tools used in devel-<br>oping solutions to programming problems.<br>The two main themes of this assignment are programming graphical user inter-<br>faces in Java and using inheritence in Java.<br>The work is set in week 9 of the module by which time you will have covered<br>the key concepts required to complete the work. However, you may find that<br>some of the material discussed after the Easter Vacation may be of use in your<br>implementation of the program.<br>1<br>Problem Specification<br>You are going to provide a version of the loans recording system (assignment 1)<br>with a GUI and some extra functionality.<br>The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items for<br>loan. The system should hold a price and a number in stock for a sale-item,<br>and a borrower and a return-date for a loan item. Thus there will be two types<br>of Item in the collection.<br>1. LoanItem: consisting of item ID and item description plus a borrower and<br>a return date; the ID consists of the letters LN followed by a three-digit<br>number;<br>2. SaleItem: consisting of item ID and description plus a price and a number<br>in stock; the ID consists of the letters SL followed by a three-digit number;<br>You are provided with two classes as a starting point for the work:<br>• Item a class representing a single item entry in the system. This class<br>contains only the ID and description; you will need to extend it to include<br>the extra data (borrower name and loan date (a long integer) in case of<br>LoanItem and description and quantity in case of SaleItem).<br>• ItemCollection a class representing the collection of item records, and<br>containing functions to save the item data (in text format) to a data file,<br>and to load item data from the file.<br>There is also a sample data file, containing IDs and descriptions only, and a<br>Main.class which illustrates loading from the data file into the item collection,<br>and saving of the item collection to the data file. More on these classes below.<br>Requirements<br>The following are essential functional requirements of the program:<br>1. The system needs to be expanded to include items for sale as well as items<br>for loan, as above.<br>• The Item class needs to be extended to classes LoanItem (record-<br>ing borrower and return data as per assignment 1) and SaleItem,<br>recording price and number in stock in addition to ID, description.<br>• The ItemCollection class needs to be extended also.<br>The ExtendedItemCollection class will inherit the ArrayList<item><br>and use this to store the two types of Item in one list, but will need<br>extra methods to support the functions set out below.<br>2<br>In particular, the Items in the collection will be a mixture of LoanItems<br>and SaleItems; your code needs to be able to distinguish these.<br>2. Your program should provide the following functions -<br>(a) issue a loan-item on loan;<br>(b) check back in a loan-item;<br>(c) sell some quantity of a sale-item (and update of the number in stock);<br>(d) list all entries;<br>(e) list all loan-item entries;<br>(f) list all loan-items currently on loan;<br>(g) list all sale-item entries;<br>3. The user interface must be a GUI.<br>Figure 1: A GUI for the application<br>General Points<br>1. You must make use of inheritance in developing this program. This should<br>involve you in extending the given Item and ItemCollection classes. Al-<br>3<br>though you may be given the source files, your program you MUST NOT<br>make any changes to these files.<br>2. All interactions must be via a GUI. Typically you can expect to make use<br>of buttons, text areas, and text fields. Your GUI should look something<br>like that depicted in figure 1.<br>3. The program should consist of a number of classes each with well defined<br>functionality. There should be a driver class to set things going; a GUI<br>class to provide the user interface; classes concerned with the address<br>book.<br>4. Your program should deal with error conditions by producing an error<br>dialogue window when the use makes a mistake (Consider the use of JOp-<br>tionPane dialogues for the error dialogues. This will require a little inves-<br>tigation on your part.)<br>5. Input could be via the ‘generic’ dialogues provided by JOptionPane; or<br>you could try making your own custom dialogues extending JDialog class.<br>6. All classes must be fully documented using Javadoc conventions.<br>7. The code you produce must adhere to the published course coding stan-<br>dards. Failure to adhere to the standards will lead to a loss of marks.<br>8. You will be expected to test your program against a suitable set of sit-<br>uations. In the documentation you should describe your testing strategy<br>(see below).<br>Design<br>You must produce design documentation. This will include a class diagram for<br>the system, a short explanation as to the general purpose of each of the classes<br>you have produced and their key methods; and a justification for any design<br>decisions you have made.<br>Implementation<br>You must provide listings for your program. The code must adhere to the Java<br>style standards as defined for the module.<br>Testing<br>You are expected to test your code. During the module we looked at strategies<br>for testing programs. You must apply these strategies to your work.<br>4<br>The testing section of your documentation indicates the approach you have<br>taken to verifying and validating your system. Just as you should not convey<br>the design of your system by presenting the code or even listing the classes,<br>you should not merely list the tests performed. Rather, discuss how tests were<br>selected, why they are sufficient, why a reader should believe that no important<br>tests were omitted, and why the reader should believe that the system will really<br>operate as desired when in use.<br>1. Strategy: An explanation of the overall strategy for testing: Black box<br>and/or white box, integration, kinds of test beds or test drivers used,<br>sources of test data, test suites. You might want to use different techniques<br>(or combinations of techniques) in different parts of the program. In each<br>case, justify your decisions.<br>2. Test Data: A set of tables showing the test data you used for each class,<br>etc. The format of the test documentation should be as follows: for each<br>test case in the tables,<br>• a unique ID<br>• a brief description of the purpose of the test<br>• the pre-conditions for running the test<br>• the test data<br>• the expected result<br>Reflection<br>You must provide a final critical evaluation of your work.<br>The reflection section is where you can generalize from specific failures or suc-<br>cesses to rules that you or others can use in future software development. What<br>surprised you most? What do you wish you knew when you started? How could<br>you have avoided problems that you encountered during development?<br>1. Evaluation: What you regard as the successes and failures of the devel-<br>opment: unresolved design problems, performance problems, etc. Identify<br>which features of your design are the important ones. Point out design<br>or implementation techniques that you are particularly proud of. Dis-<br>cuss what mistakes you made in your design, and the problems that they<br>caused.<br>2. Lessons: What lessons you learned from the experience: how you might<br>do it differently a second time round, and how the faults of the design and<br>implementation may be corrected. Describe factors that caused problems<br>such as missed milestones or to the known bugs and limitations.<br>5<br>3. Known Bugs and Limitations: In what ways does your implementation<br>fall short of the specification? Be precise. Although you will lose points<br>for bugs and missing features, you will receive partial credit for accurately<br>identifying those errors, and the source of the problem.<br>This should be 1 to 2 pages long.<br>Deliverables<br>You are expected to submit the following items:<br>1. Your working Java classes, source code and project files (if approriate).<br>JUnit test classes and sources should be included. Your Java source code<br>should<br>(a) be fully commented in the JavaDoc style;<br>(b) adhere to the defined coding standards.<br>2. a .jar file containing your application classes.<br>3. The HTML documentation produced by JavaDoc.<br>4. A report containing the following sections:<br>(a) A cover page giving your name, University ID, and module details;<br>(b) Design documentation as outlined above;<br>(c) All the test documentation outlned above;<br>(d) Your reflection and critical evaluation, as outlined above<br>(e) Brief instructions on running your program (this will not be marked);<br>Submission is electronic. Electronic Copies of your work should be sub-<br>mitted via the assignment mechanism on the eLP (Blackboard). Separate links<br>will be provided for (1) a ZIP containing your java source, classes, etc, your<br>jar file and your Javadoc-generted documentation; and (2) your report, in PDF<br>format.<br>Academic integrity<br>You must adhere to the university regulations on academic conduct. Formal<br>inquiry proceedings will be instigated if there is any suspicion of plagiarism or<br>any other form of misconduct in your work. Refer to the Universitys Assessment<br>Regulations for Northumbria Awards if you are unclear as to the meaning of<br>these terms. The latest copy is available on the University website.<br>6<br>Classes Provided<br>Your have been given the following .class files from which you will build your<br>new system:<br>• Entry.class<br>• AddressBook.class<br>The documentation for each class is also provided but you should not count on<br>seeing the source code. It is intended that you use the functionality provided<br>by these classes without modifying them in any way.<br>To use these classes<br>1. In BlueJ create the project for the assignment<br>2. Copy the .class files into the folder created for this project. They might<br>NOT appear immediately inside BlueJ although later on you may see<br>them.<br>3. Now start to add your own classes.<br>Assessment<br>Feedback will be provided at the end of the semester, about 3 weeks after<br>submission, by inerview or by e-mail.<br>The marking for the assignment is designed to reflect the general guidance given<br>on the University’s web site for the assessment of postgraduate work. Some<br>modifications to the generic criteria have been made to better reflect the nature<br>of the assignment. The marking scheme is set out below.<br>70-100 Distinction Excellent work providing evidence to a very high level of the<br>knowledge, understanding and skills appropriate to level 7. All learning<br>outcomes met, many at high level. Marks at the high end of this range<br>indicate outstanding work where all learning outcomes are met at a high<br>level.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>java的网络编程，主要是一个FileSender 发送类和一个FileReceiver接收类， 考察了网络编程的基础知识，CRC32 Checksum验证，<br>消息头的封装和解封，数据的传输等等知识<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>Page 1 of 6<br>Assignment 2<br>Introduction<br>In this assignment, you will transfer a file over UDP protocol on top of an unreliable channel<br>that may either corrupt or drop packets randomly (but always deliver packets in order).<br>Writing Your Programs<br>You are free to write your programs on any platform/IDE that you are familiar with.<br>Grading<br>Your programs will be graded according to their correctness using a grading script:<br>• [2 points] Programs are compilable on sunfire, program execution follows specified<br>Java commands (see sections below).<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver when channel is<br>perfectly reliable (i.e. no error at all).<br>Page 2 of 6<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet corruption.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>data packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence of<br>ACK/NAK packet loss.<br>• [1 point] Programs can successfully transfer a file from sender to receiver in the presence<br>of both packet corruption and packet loss.<br>To conclude a successful file transfer, received file must have identical content as the<br>sent one (use command cmp to check it on sunfire). Your program should work for<br>both text and binary files, and for both small files and large files (a few MBs).<br>Grading script doesn’t care what messages your programs print on the screen. It just checks<br>if the received file is exactly the same as the sent one in respective test cases.<br>• [2 points] (Who runs faster?) Time taken for your programs to transfer an enormous file<br>(more than 10MB) in the presence of both packet corruption and packet loss will be noted<br>down. The fastest batch of student programs will receive 2 marks and slower programs that<br>are still faster than average will receive 1 mark. J<br>You may apply the knowledge gained from this or other courses as appropriate. However,<br>since the objective of this assignment is to design a fast network transmission protocol,<br>you are NOT allowed to play tricks (e.g., data compression) to gain unfair advantage<br>over your peers. Please consult the teaching team if you are unsure if certain techniques<br>can be used or not.<br>A Word of Advice<br>This assignment is complex and time-consuming. You are suggested to write programs<br>incrementally and modularly. For example, deal with data packet corruption first, then ACK<br>packet corruption, then data packet loss, etc. Test your programs after every single major<br>change. Take note that partial credit will be awarded even if your programs don’t meet all listed<br>requirements.<br>Page 3 of 6<br>Overall Architecture<br>There are three programs in this assignment, FileSender, UnreliNET and<br>FileReceiver. Their relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 below. The FileSender and<br>FileReceiver programs implement a file transfer application over UDP protocol. The<br>UnreliNET program simulates the transmission channel that transmits packets unreliably and<br>randomly corrupts or loses packets. However, for simplicity, you can assume that this channel<br>always delivers packets in order.<br>Figure 1: UnreliNet Simulates Unreliable Network<br>The UnreliNET program acts as a proxy between FileSender and FileReceiver.<br>Instead of sending packets directly to FileReceiver, FileSender sends all packets to<br>UnreliNET. UnreliNET may introduce bit errors to packets or lose packets randomly. It<br>then forwards packets (if not lost) to FileReceiver. When receiving feedback packets from<br>FileReceiver, UnreliNET may also corrupt them or lose them with certain probability<br>before relaying them to FileSender.<br>The UnreliNET program is complete and given. Your task in this assignment is to develop the<br>FileSender and FileReceiver programs so that a file can be successfully transferred<br>from sender to receiver in the presence of possible packet corruption and packet loss. The<br>received file should be identical to the file sent. You may need to implement techniques learnt<br>in lecture, including sequence number, acknowledgement, timeout and retransmission, to<br>ensure that packets are correctly delivered.<br>FileSender Class<br>The FileSender program is basically a file uploader that opens a given file and sends its<br>content as a sequence of packets to UnreliNet. UnreliNet would then corrupt/lose<br>packets with certain probability before relaying them to the FileReceiver program.<br>To run FileSender on sunfire, type command:<br>java  FileSender  <path filename=""></path>  <unrelinetip><br><unrelinetport> <rcvfilename><br>For example:<br>java FileSender ../test/cny.mp3 localhost 9000 gxfc.mp3<br>sends the file cny.mp3 from directory (relative path) ../test to UnreliNet running in<br>the same host at port 9000. UnreliNet will then pass the file to your FileReceiver<br>program to be stored as gxfc.mp3.<br>UnreliNET  FileSender  FileReceiver<br>Page 4 of 6<br>(Note: Windows system uses a different file separator ‘\’, e.g., ..\test\cny.mp3)<br>You may assume that during testing, your sender program will be supplied with the correct<br>path and filename (no more than 100 bytes long). No input validation is needed.<br>UnreliNET Class<br>The UnreliNET program simulates an unreliable channel that may corrupt or lose packets<br>with a certain probability. This program is given and shouldn’t be changed.<br>To run UnreliNET on sunfire, type command:<br>java  UnreliNET  <p_data_corrupt>  <p_ack_corrupt><br><p_data_loss> <p_ack_loss> <unrelinetport> <rcvhostname><br><rcvport><br>For example:<br>java UnreliNET 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 9000 localhost 9001<br>listens on port 9000 and forwards all received data packets to FileReceiver running on the<br>same host at port 9001, with 30% chance of packet corruption and 10% chance of packet loss.<br>The UnreliNET program also forwards ACK/NAK packets to FileSender, with 20% packet<br>corruption rate and 5% packet loss rate.<br>Packet Corruption Probability<br>The UnreliNET program randomly corrupts or loses data packets and ACK/NAK packets<br>according to the specified parameters P_DATA_CORRUPT, P_ACK_CORRUPT P_ACK_LOSS and<br>P_ACK_LOSS. You can set these values to anything in the range [0, 0.3] during testing (setting a<br>too large corruption/loss rate may result in a very slow file transmission).<br>If you have trouble getting your code to work, it might be advisable to set them to 0 first for<br>debugging purposes.<br>FileReceiver Class<br>The FileReceiver program receives a file from FileSender (through UnreliNET) and<br>saves it in the same directory as the FileReceiver program, with a filename specified by<br>FileSender.<br>To run FileReceiver on sunfire, type command:<br>java FileReceiver <rcvport><br>For example:<br>java FileReceiver 9001<br>listens on port 9001 and dumps the bytes received into a file whose name is given by sender.<br>Page 5 of 6<br>Running All Three Programs<br>You should first launch FileReceiver, followed by UnreliNET in the second window.<br>Finally, launch FileSender in a third window to start data transmission. All programs should<br>receive user input from command-line argument only. Please always test your programs in<br>localhost to avoid the interference of network traffic on your programs.<br>The UnreliNET program simulates unreliable communication network and runs infinitely.<br>Once launched, you may reuse it in consecutive tests. To manually terminate it, press <ctrl> + c.<br>The UnreliNET program prints out information that is helpful in debugging your programs.<br>However, we will disable such outputs in speed test.<br>The sender and receiver programs shouldn’t communicate with each other directly – all traffic<br>should be forwarded by the UnreliNET program. The sender program should terminate<br>properly (e.g., no exception, no infinite loop) once transmission finishes. However, you may<br>leave the receiver program running infinitely (i.e., no need for receiver to detect end of<br>transmission and terminate, but DO remember to close the file output stream at the end).<br>Self-defined Header/Trailer Fields at Application Layer<br>UDP transmission is unreliable. To detect packet corruption or packet loss, you may need to<br>implement reliability checking and recovery mechanisms at application layer. The following<br>header/trailer fields are suggested though you may have your own design:<br> Sequence number<br> Checksum<br>Note that each packet FileSender sends should contain at most 1000 bytes of application<br>data (inclusive of self-defined header/trailer fields), or UnreliNET program will reject it.<br>Computing Checksum<br>To detect bit errors, FileSender should compute checksum for every outgoing packet and<br>embed it in the packet. FileReceiver needs to re-compute checksum to verify the integrity<br>of a received packet.<br>Please refer to Assignment 0 Exercise 3 on how to compute checksum using Java CRC32 class.<br>Timer and Timeout Value<br>Sender may have to maintain a timer for unacknowledged packet. You are suggested to use the<br>setSoTimeout() method of Java Socket class.<br>You shouldn’t set a timeout value that is larger than 200ms, or your program might be too slow<br>in transmitting data and thus get killed by the grading script.<br>Page 6 of 6<br>Reading/Writing Values to Header/Trailer Fields<br>The number of header/trailer fields and the sequence of their appearance in a packet is the<br>agreement between sender and receiver (i.e. an application layer protocol designed by you).<br>As discussed in tutorial 3, to give value to a header field of a 4-byte integer, you may consider<br>ByteBuffer class from java.nio package. An example is shown below.<br>At sender side:<br>int length = 1000;<br>// allocate a 4-byte array to store converted integer<br>byte[] pktLen = ByteBuffer.allocate(4).putInt(length).array();<br>// copy content of pktLen to the beginning of output buffer of pkt<br>System.arraycopy(pktLen, 0, buffer, 0, pktLen.length);<br>At receiver side:<br>// extract the first 4 bytes of a packet as the integer ‘length’<br>ByteBuffer wrapper = ByteBuffer.wrap(pkt.getData(), 0, 4);<br>int length = wrapper.getInt();<br><br><br></ctrl></rcvport></rcvport></rcvhostname></unrelinetport></p_ack_loss></p_data_loss></p_ack_corrupt></p_data_corrupt></rcvfilename></unrelinetport></unrelinetip></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>用c语言写一个多人聊天室，大致要求就是做一个能够实现自由加入和退出的聊天室。 一个人发送信息其他人<br>都能收到，消息发送成功要有个提示。每个人加入和退出也会有提示，前面的英<br>文有举例。多人聊天的时候可以分辨出来那句话是谁发的。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>you will implement a multi-user chat program. In C program please.<br>The Bare Minimum<br>The minimum requirement is for a central server that can accept two connections.<br>Either client can then type a message, which is then sent to the server. The server<br>relays the message to the other client. A sample run of the program might look like the<br>following:<br>&gt; ./chat 127.0.0.1<br>What is your screen name? &gt;&gt; KitC<br>KitC has joined the chat.<br>Linda has joined the chat.<br>&gt;&gt; Hi, Linda. Are we having our meeting later today?<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>Linda: No. I’m really busy writing our paper and<br>a couple other people have conflicts.<br>&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks!<br>[Your Message Has Been Sent]<br>&gt;&gt; exit<br>KitC has left the chat.<br>This is only an example interface, but shows the minimum requirements of sending<br>messages between the clients. A confirmation that your message has been sent by the<br>client is also a requirement at this level.<br>Level 2 Requirements<br>In Level 2, a few more features may be added. In the example above, there were<br>notifications when a user entered or left the chat. Level 2 code should add this feature.<br>At this level, the server should be able to accept multiple connections | not just two.<br>That means that the server needs to keep track of who sent a message and distribute<br>it to all of the other clients except the one who sent it.<br>Buffet Features<br>If you have time or interest, you can add any or all of the following features.<br>Private messages between clients (Something like @replies in Twitter)<br>Sending a message to a subset of clients<br>Add some pretty formatting to the messages (like colors, line wrapping, etc.)<br><br></font>
