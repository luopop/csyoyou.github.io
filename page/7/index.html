        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>unix的IPC通讯，涉及到消息队列，共享内存等等多进程知识，是操作系统的必须课程<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br>In this assignment you are to develop a chat program between two users, similar to the<br>one already available on the UNIX system called talk. When two instances of your<br>program are being run simultaneously on the system, a user typing in one instance will be<br>able to send the message typed to the user running the other instance of the program.<br>User interface can be a very simple one by using printf() and scanf() functions of the C<br>programming language. IPC mechanism is going to be developed using Message Queues.<br>Important: You should design your code so that when the user is waiting to type a<br>message, at the same time messages are being retrieved from the queue if they arrive in it.<br>This requires multi-threaded program.<br>Specifics<br>IPC Introduction and naming<br>Under UNIX operating system, apart from pipes and signals as primitive type of IPC,<br>from System V release new techniques were added: message queues, semaphores and<br>shared memory. You can investigate the status of IPC facilities on the system by entering<br>ipcs –b on the command prompt. IPC Message queues will exist even after the process<br>creating it terminates, thus it should be manually removed with the ipcrm –q <id><br>command, since IPC resources on a system are limited.<br>IPC system calls related to the Message Queues that is the mechanism of choice for the<br>IPC are: msgget for allocating an IPC or gaining access to an existing queue. msgctl to<br>control an IPC, modify its status and/or remove it. Lastly, for sending and receiving<br>messages msgsnd and msgrcv are used.<br>Once an IPC facility is created using the msgget function, an IPC identifier is returned by<br>the system. The user creating the IPC facility identified by the returned identifier should<br>specify the access permissions. Header <sys ipc.h=""> defines the IPC permissions structure<br>called: ipc_perm. Also, <sys types.h=""> needs to be included in every program before the<br>sys/ipc.h is included.<br>The unique system-wide identifier identifies message queues. To create such an identifier<br>of type key_t defined in the <sys ipc.h=""> file, ftok() function should be used. If ftok() is<br>called with the same arguments from two different processes, the same key would be<br>produced, thus two different processes would be able to access the same IPC facility.<br>For example:<br>key_t key;<br>key = ftok(“.”, 123);<br>First argument is the reference to an existing accessible file (in UNIX, file “.” – a<br>reference to the current directory is always available and accessible). Second argument is<br>some integer, referred to as an id. There are also constants to be passed as an ID: for<br>example IPC_PRIVATE that assures that returned key is always unique.<br>Creating Message Queue<br>A message queue is created using the msgget system call. If successful, a non-negative<br>integer is returned which is a message queue identifier that can be used in subsequent<br>calls that reference it. First parameter is the key returned by ftok(), and the second<br>parameter is the access permission that is of the same format as the chmod command<br>parameter. Passing 0777 would give read and write permissions to everyone on the<br>system. To verify proper access permissions are made, once the queue is created, you can<br>observe set permissions with the ipcs –b command described at the beginning of this<br>section. Furthermore, use the IPC_CREAT flag ORed with the 0777 to assure that the<br>queue is created if it does not exist or if it already exist, an identifier to it is simply<br>returned.<br>For example:<br>mq_handle = msgget(key, IPC_CREAT | 0777);<br>if(mq_handle&lt;=-1) {<br>printf(“Error creating message queue\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”); /<em> print the error </em>/<br>return(1);<br>}<br>Obtaining information about the message queue<br>Using the msgctl function and the IPC_STAT flag passed to it, information about the<br>queue, its owner, number of bytes on the queue, number of messages, etc…can be<br>obtained. An include file <sys msg.h=""> needs also to be included in the program.<br>For example:<br>struct msqid_ds *info;<br>int ret;<br>…<br>ret = msgctl(mq_handle, IPC_STAT, info);<br>if(ret==-1) {<br>printf(“Failed to obtain message queue information\n”);<br>perror(“MQ Sample”);exit(1); }<br>printf(“# of messages on queue: %d\n”, info-&gt;msg_qnum);<br>Communicating through Message Queue<br>A message is defined in the struct msgbuf in the include file <sys msg.h="">. First field of<br>the structure, mtype, is an user-defined positive integer id, agreed between the programs<br>using the message queue to selectively retrieve the messages from it. Suppose, 4<br>programs (instances of the chat program) are using the same message queue, in that case<br>the following should be done to assure proper bi-directional communication:<br>Instance 1  Instance 2  Instance 3  Instance 4<br>Instance 1  –  12  13  14<br>Instance 2  21  –  23  24<br>Instance 3  31  32  –  34<br>Instance 4  41  42  43  –<br>For example:<br>Instance 1 will use mtype=12 to send a message to the Instance 2 and also Instance 1 will<br>retrieve messages that have mtype=21. Instance 2 will use mtype=12 to retrieve messages<br>from the queue from the Instance 1 and it will use mtype=21 to send a message to the<br>Instance 1. Thus, we assure that there is a bi-directional communication on the same<br>channel (same message queue) that is shared by many instances of the same chat program<br>and messages are not delivered to the wrong instance.<br>msgsend()<br>msgsend() takes four parameters and it returns 0 on success and –1 on failure setting the<br>errno global variable to a pre-specified number that can be examined to retrieve the error<br>(or by using perror() function to get a meaningful message).<br>First parameter is the identifier of the message queue. Second parameter is the pointer to<br>the actual message. Third parameter is the size of the message obtained by using the<br>sizeof operator, and the last parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is one flag, which<br>causes a non-blocking send (send would block if the queue was full) or a zero can be<br>passed if no flags are needed).<br>msgrcv()<br>msgrcv() takes five parameters. First one is the queue identifier. Second one is the pointer<br>to where the received message will be placed (receiver’s end structure should have the<br>first member as ulong to assure message type can be correctly written). Third one is the<br>maximum size of the message that can be received. Fourth parameter specifies which<br>messages should be received: an identifier used in mtype at the sender’s side or 0 to<br>retrieve all messages. Fifth parameter is the flags. IPC_NOWAIT is to create a no-<br>blocking receive and MSG_NOERROR is not to produce any error if the message<br>received is bigger than the maximum size specified. If MSG_NOERROR is not specified<br>and message received is larger than the maximum specified size an error will occur.<br>msgrcv() returns –1 on failure or number of bytes received if it is successful. On error, it<br>also sets errno global variable able to be retrieved using perror().<br>Submission<br>You should submit your C program on Carmen along with details on how to run it and<br>anything else that would allow the grader to grade your work.<br><br><br></sys></sys></sys></sys></sys></id></font>

In this project, a simple and<br>effective inventory management and record system is developed in order to record, search and<br>back up the data of various items in the company. To avoid any conflict between different data<br>types and any other programming bugs, Input data validation processes are necessary to be<br>employed and developed in the system.<br>1.1) File Format for data storage:<br>In this project, one data file “inventory.txt” is required to back up the data. The “inventory.txt”<br>file contains various data for each item (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status). In this project, we assume that the maximum<br>numbers of item records are 50 and the maximum numbers of characters for name of item,<br>recipient, destination and delivery status) are 30.<br>The format and example of data stored in the data file “inventory.txt” are listed as follows:<br>Name of item #1<br>Item number #1<br>Subject #1<br>Weight #1<br>Quantity #1<br>Recipient #1<br>Final Destination #1<br>Delivery Status #1<br>Name of item #2<br>Item number #2<br>Subject #2<br>Weight #2<br>Quantity #2<br>Recipient #2<br>Final Destination #2<br>Delivery Status #2<br>Name of item #3<br>Item number #3<br>Subject #3<br>Weight #3<br>Quantity #3<br>Recipient #3<br>Final Destination #3<br>Delivery Status #3<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>2 / 6<br>The example of items records stored in the data file is listed as follows:<br>Net Wi-Fi Router<br>1001<br>Electronics<br>2.0 kg<br>1<br>Chan Tai Man<br>Kowloon Bay<br>Delivery<br>Fujo Apple Gift Set<br>Food<br>2552<br>1.2kg<br>1<br>Cheung Wai Ming<br>Yuen Long<br>Arrival<br>Koppo Men Jacket<br>Fashion<br>3003<br>0.5kg<br>2<br>Lee Siu Yu<br>Sha Tin<br>Warehouse<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>3 / 6<br>2)  Project Requirements<br>In this project, students are required to form groups in the same class (4 to max. 5 students per<br>group) to develop a C program (Standalone Console-Based Application) for the inventory<br>management and record system. The C program for this system must include two parts: (1) Basic<br>Functions (group part), and (2) Extra Functions (individual part).<br>The example of Basic Functions (group part) of the system is shown as follows:<br>2.1) Requirements for Basic Function (Group Part)<br>The following functions must be supported in the system:<br> Main Menu: in the main() function<br>o  Show menu page when the program is executed or selected option is completed.<br>o  After the main menu is shown, wait for user to input a number (or character) from<br>options above.<br>  Option ‘1’: Add new item record(s)<br>o  Add a new item in the system and store the information of such item in a data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Record “Name of item”, “Item number”, “Subject”, “Weight”, “Quantity”, “Recipient”,<br>“Final destination” and “Delivery status”.<br>o  Ask user to add another new item (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu page).<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>4 / 6<br>  Option ‘2’: Display item(s)<br>o  Load and display the items in the system from the corresponding data file<br>“inventory.txt”.<br>o  Display all the item information (Name of item, Item number, Subject, Weight, Quantity,<br>Recipient, Final destination, and Delivery status) line by line on screen.<br>  Option ‘3’: Modify item record(s)<br>o  Update the existing item record and store it to the corresponding data file.<br>o  Ask user to change another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘4’: Delete item record(s)<br>o  Delete the existing item record and update the records in the data file.<br>o  Ask user to remove another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>  Option ‘5’: Search item information<br>o  Search and display the item information you searched on screen from the corresponding<br>data file “invenotory.txt”.<br>o  Ask user to search another item record (if Yes, repeat the step; if No, go back to menu<br>page).<br>2.2) Requirements for Extra Function (Individual Part)<br>Each group member is required to develop an extra function (e.g. create a new Option ‘6’ or a new<br>function, etc.) and integrate to the system for this project. These extra functions can be contributed<br>and integrated to the system so as to perform various specific tasks or related purposes. There is no<br>constraint on the function features (except user login with password).<br>Input data<br>Add data for next item<br>ICP Project 15-16<br>5 / 6<br>3)  Submission<br>3.1) Softcopies<br>a) Programming Codes and Files:<br>Softcopies must be submitted to SOUL by a group representative before the deadline.

You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from<br>the due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction for<br>failure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10<br>points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),<br>and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA that<br>your program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>(90 pts) Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You will write a program to play blackjack using C++ classes. Blackjack is a card<br>game that has a dealer and 1 or more players who are trying to get a hand closest to 21<br>without going over. Aces can be 1 or 11, whichever is to your advantage, and all face<br>value cards (Jack, Queen and King) have a value of 10.<br>The players begin with a specific amount of money, and only the players can bet<br>against the dealer. First, everyone decides how much he/she wants to bet. Then,<br>everyone is dealt 2 cards face up, and the dealer gets one face up and one face down.<br>Each player decides whether to receive another card or not without going over 21. If<br>the player goes over 21 (or busts), then he/she immediately loses their bet from their<br>total playing money. After all players finish receiving cards, then the dealer turns over<br>the card that is facing down, and the dealer must receive a new card if the total is below<br>17 and stay/hold if the total is 17 or above.<br> The players with totals over 21 immediately lose their bet from their playing total.<br> If the dealer goes over 21, then the players with 21 and under all win their bet,<br>which is added to their playing total.<br> If the dealer is 21 or under, then the players with card totals less than the dealer<br>lose their bet from their playing total, and those players with card totals greater<br>than the dealer win their bet, which is added to their playing total.<br> Players who have the same card total as the dealer neither win nor lose, their<br>playing total remains unchanged.<br> Players who have a card total of 21, blackjack, win 1.5% their bet to their playing<br>total.<br>You will be required to have the following classes and members. However, you<br>may add more members and functions, based on your design. You will make .cpp<br>files for each class, .h, interface file. Make sure you include the correct .h files<br>with the .cpp files.<br>//card.h interface file<br>class card {<br>private:<br>int value; //1-13<br>char <em>suit; //4 each: club, spade, heart, diamond<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//deck.h interface file<br>class deck {<br>private:<br>card cards[52];<br>int num_cards;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//hand.h interface file<br>class hand {<br>private:<br>card </em>cards;<br>int num_cards;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//player.h interface file<br>class player {<br>private:<br>hand p_hand;<br>int playing_total;<br>int card_total;<br>int bet;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//dealer.h interface file<br>class dealer {<br>private:<br>hand d_hand;<br>int card_total;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>//game.h interface file<br>class game {<br>private:<br>deck cards;<br>player <em>players;<br>dealer game_dealer;<br>int num_players;<br>public:<br>//must have constructors<br>//must have destructors<br>//must have accessor functions<br>//must have mutator functions<br>};<br>Your program must be able to:<br> Setup a deck of 52 cards with spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts of 2-10, Jack,<br>Queen, King, and Ace for each suit.<br> Shuffle the deck of cards before playing any game.<br> Determine how many players and the playing total for each.<br> Make sure that a player’s bet is less than or equal to the playing total.<br> Determine when a full deck has been dealt, and reshuffle.<br> You should not have any memory leaks in your program.<br>Extra Credit (10 pts):<br>In blackjack, if a player starts with doubles (cards with the same value), then the cards<br>can be split into different hands. The player is given two cards, one for each hand, and<br>the dealer now gets two cards for a different hand. After the first hand is played, then<br>the second hand is played between the dealer and the player who split.<br>(10 pts) Program Style/Comments<br>In your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,<br>in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments! Below is an example<br>header to include. Make sure you review the style guidelines for this class, and begin<br>trying to follow them, i.e. don’t align everything on the left or put everything on one line!<br><a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf</a><br>/<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br><strong> Program: play_game.cpp

You are required to meet with a TA within one week after<br>the due date to demo. You are penalized for failure to see a TA within the week or<br>missing a scheduled appointment. In either case, if you are within 1 day (24<br>hours) of the deadline, you lose 10 points. If you are within 7 days (1 week) of the<br>deadline, then you lose 25 points, anything outside of a week from the deadline<br>to demo is an automatic 50 point deduction. Your job is to convince the TA that your<br>program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>During your time in programming, you will undoubtedly run into a situation where you<br>will need to go through information more than once or need to perform the same task<br>over and over. The way we as programmers accomplish this is through the use of<br>loops and functions.<br>(90 pts) Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You will write a program to compare state and county information. You must<br>have the following structs in your program.<br>struct county {<br>string name; //name of county<br>string <em>city; //name of cities in county<br>int cities; //number of cities in county<br>int population; //total population of county<br>float avg_income; //avg household income<br>float avg_house; //avg household price<br>};<br>struct state {<br>string name; //name of state<br>struct county </em>c; //name of counties<br>int counties; //number of counties in state<br>int population; //total population of state<br>};<br>You will receive the number of states and filename from the user as command-line<br>arguments.

A generic class is a general version of a class; it<br>is a homogenous data structure that handles multiple data types. MyArray will be similar to C++<br>arrays but will not be constrained to a fixed size. The array size will grow dynamically when the user<br>inserts an element to a full array. The class should not use vectors. Instead, you should use<br>dynamic memory allocation (a dynamic array).<br>The class should use three member variables:<br>-  myarray: the dynamic array<br>-  size: the current size of the array<br>-  used: the number of elements currently used in the array<br>The class should have the following functionalities:<br>? A default constructor that initializes the size of the array to 5.<br>? A default destructor that frees the dynamic memory that was allocated.<br>? int length( ) a method that returns an integer value indicating the number of elements<br>currently used in the array.<br>? void insertHead(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the first element in the<br>array. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace the<br>existing array.<br>? void insertTail(Item i) a method that inserts a new item making it the last element in the<br>array. If the array is full, then a new dynamic array of double the size should replace the<br>existing array.<br>? void deleteHead( ) deletes the first element in the array.<br>? void deleteTail( ) deletes the last element in the array.<br>? void sortAscending( ) sorts the elements of the array in ascending order. Use bubbleSort to<br>do that.<br>? void sortDescending( ) sorts the elements of the array in descending order. Use<br>insertionSort to do that.<br>? C++ allows the overloading of the [ ] operator. This feature makes it possible to access<br>an element in a MyArray object in an array-like behavior. Overload this operator and<br>make sure to have boundary checks using assertions. If the user tries to access an<br>element outside the range of the array or at a location that is not used yet then an error<br>message should be displayed on the screen.<br>For example, the following code:<br>P a g e | 2<br>MyArray<int> a1;<br>cout &lt;&lt; “Number of elements in a1= “ &lt;&lt; a1.length() &lt;&lt; endl;<br>a1.insertTail(35);<br>a1.insertTail(45);<br>a1.insertHead(55);<br>a1.deleteTail();<br>for(int i =0; i &lt; a1.length(); i++)<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[i] &lt;&lt; endl;<br>Will result in:<br>Number of elements in a1= 0<br>55<br>35<br>If we try any of the two instructions the result should be an assertion error:<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[4]; //Subscript uninitialized.<br>cout &lt;&lt; a1[14]; //Subscript out of range.<br>Write a main( ) method that provides a menu driven interface that allows the user to test whether<br>each member function of myArray is working properly. The menu should provide the following<br>functionalities:<br>o Create a new array: allows the user to create an array of one of the following types: bool, char,<br>double, float, int, string<br>o Get Length: the current number of elements used in the array<br>o Insert a new element at the head of the array<br>o Insert a new element at the tail of the array<br>o Delete the first element<br>o Delete the last element<br>o Sort the elements in ascending order<br>o Sort the elements in descending order<br>o Print all the elements in the array<br>o Quit the program<br>What to hand in<br>Please submit your C++ source file electronically through Angel.<br><br><br></int></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>c++模拟一个汽车运动模型，文件输入运行轨迹，车辆情况等等。根据一些数学和物理的公式，计算最后的汽车运动情况，同时考虑到c++的类的设计，要求类设计完好。<br>control类，driver类，read类，write类等等功能分离使得思路更加清晰代码明了<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Usage<br>Usage: catcar controlInputs stateOutputs<br>Requirements Summary<br>Create a C++ program that reads control inputs for a self­driving car from an input file. The program will simulate the car’s<br>state over the time horizon given by the control inputs, and write the results to an output file. The major problem is: the input<br>file was written in such a way that the control inputs are stored out of order!<br>Assignment Name<br>The assignment name for this assignment is: ​catcar<br>1. Kinematic Model Simulation<br>In this project, you will create a program that controls an autonomous vehicle from an input control file. The only problem is<br>that the input controls are jumbled, since a function that operated on the linked list that stored them was badly designed: they<br>were stored in order in a queue, but the queue was designed by a Visual Basic programmer who doesn’t understand memory.<br>They printed the nodes out by order of memory address of the list nodes, instead of by the node order prescribed by the next<br>pointers.<br>So you need to put them back in the right order before proceeding. This program will read in time value at which this<br>command should be executed, then the commanded speed, and tire angle. The duration of the command is the difference<br>between this command’s time value, and the next time value (when the nodes are in order), at a maximum of 201 ms. If there<br>are any durations longer than 201 ms, the input file should be declared invalid, and no simulation should take place.<br>With this sequence of commands, you should save the vehicle’s state at each time step. During the execution of control<br>commands, this program will record the vehicle’s state as it moves (or stands still), and save the output states to a file.<br>2. File Format<br>2.1 controlInputs<br>For this assignment, the input text file will consist of control information, each line contains sample time (in seconds),<br>commanded vehicle velocity (m/s), and tire angle rate (radians/s), with elements separated by whitespace (even the first<br>number could be padded by a whitespace in the front). All values should be stored as doubles.<br>0.06 5 0.523<br>0.02 20 ­0.523<br>0.07 8 0<br>0.00 0 0<br>In this example, at time 0.06 the vehicle should take in as its input command a velocity of 5, with a tire­angle rate of 0.523,<br>for 0.01 seconds. The duration of 0.01 is determined by looking at the next time step (after the vector is confirmed to be<br>sorted), and taking the difference (0.07 ­  0.06).<br>Clearly the above example is an extreme case of driving aggressively. Your program should run regardless of the unlikely<br>control inputs, as long as the below conditions are met:<br>­ The rst element of the sorted list must be at exactly time 0.<br>­ Commanded tire angle rate must be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e., / 6 radians/sec). ±π<br>­ Commanded velocity must be between [0, 30] m/s;<br>­ Time values must be non­negative; and<br>­ Duration between sorted input objects must be between [5, 201] ms.<br>If any of these are violated for any input value in the file, then the ​controlInputs file is deemed invalid, and an empty<br>output file is written. If at any time a line fails to parse, then the file should be declared invalid. This policy is for safety: you<br>wouldn’t want to start controlling an autonomous car if you accidentally passed in the wrong file, and it started somehow<br>parsing lines!<br>2.2 outputFile<br>This assignment should output a file with information on the state values of the vehicle throughout its journey. The format for<br>this file is one called csv (comma separated values), and is common for inputting data into MATLAB. Each output entry is as<br>follows:<br>t,x1,x2,x3,x4\n<br>Where t is the time at which this state value was measured, and the values in x are given by the kinematic equation (1). The<br>precision for each value should be whatever is the default when using C++ iostream methods.<br>If the control inputs are determined to be invalid, you should create an empty file with the name provided from the command<br>line.<br>3. Vehicle Model<br>You are developing a vehicle simulator, which describes the kinematic motion of a front­steered, two­wheel drive vehicle.<br>The vehicle you are simulating is visually depicted below. The equations of motion for this vehicle are provided in (1).<br>x<br>​<br>1 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ ) cos(​x<br>​<br>4​ )<br>(1)<br>x<br>​<br>2 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ ) sin(​x<br>​<br>4​ )<br>x<br>​<br>3 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>2<br>x<br>​<br>4 ​ = ​u<br>​<br>1 ​ (1/L) sin(​x<br>​<br>3​ )<br>Where ​x<br>​<br>1 is translational forward motion, ​x<br>​<br>2 is translational left/right motion, x<br>​<br>3 is the tire angle, and ​x<br>​<br>4 is the heading of the<br><br>vehicle. For control inputs, ​u<br>​<br>1 represents vehicle velocity, and ​u<br>​<br>2 represents angular rate of change for the tire angle. The<br><br>wheelbase L is defined in the Vehicle.h header file.<br>Using a simple discretization of these differential equations with a duration ​t<br>​<br>, we can use the following equations for motion:<br>x<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ )​   ​ = ​x<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ∆​ t​  ​u<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>)​  ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>)) cos(​x<br>​<br>4​ (​t<br>​<br>))  (2)<br>x<br>​<br>2 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ ) = ​x<br>​<br>2 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) +​<br>​<br>∆​ t​  ​u<br>​<br>1​ (​t<br>​<br>)​  ​ cos(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>)) sin(​x<br>​<br>4​ (​t<br>​<br>))<br>x<br>​<br>3 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ )​  ​ = ​x<br>​<br>3 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ​<br>​<br>∆​ t ​ u<br>​<br>2​ (​t<br>​<br>)<br>x<br>​<br>4 ​ (​t<br>​<br>+∆​ t​ ) = ​x<br>​<br>4 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) + ​<br>​<br>∆​ t ​ u<br>​<br>1 ​ (​t<br>​<br>) (1/L) sin(​x<br>​<br>3​ (​t<br>​<br>))<br>The value for ​x<br>​<br>3 (tire angle) must always be between [?­0.5236, 0.5236] radians/sec (i.e.,<br>/ 6 radians/sec). If a value is                             ±π<br>commanded outside this range, then ​x<br>​<br>3 should saturate using the above range. Ex: If the tire angle rate is commanded to be<br><br>the value 0.7156, the tire angle rate should equal the maximum value of 0.5236.<br>The heading should always be between [0, 2 ). If the heading is a negative value, the heading should be converted into the               π<br>range [0, 2 ) by repeatedly adding 2  . Ex: If the heading is ­.5 , the heading can be converted to ­0.5 +2  = 1.5 . π π π π π π<br>Defined values are present for these ranges inside of ​State.h<br>4. Class designs<br>The following class definitions must be used for the indicated classes. You may (if you wish) create your own classes to do<br>other tasks. The below classes are prescribed in whole (or in part):<br>Input​, ​State​, ​Vehicle​ (must use exact prescribed class definitions)<br>DataSource​, ​DataSink​, ​Director​ (are at your discretion, except for the sort method prescribed).<br>4.1 Classes that must use prescribed definitions<br>Please use the exact interfaces for Vehicle, State, and Input, or your alpha release may not compile. These are the only classes<br>for which the design is fixed.<br>4.1.1 Input<br>The ​Input class holds the values for the u variables used in the kinematic model. Its interface is included on Piazza as a<br>resource for this Project.<br>4.1.2 State<br>The ​State class is similar to Input, and its interface is included on Piazza as a resource for this Project. However, it does<br>ensure that tire angle values and heading values stay within the designated ranges if the setters for the class are called.<br>4.2 Vehicle<br>The ​Vehicle class executes a control input for the designated duration. The interface is included on Piazza as a resource for<br>this Project.<br>The ​Vehicle keeps its own state, receives a control input, and updates its state. The initial state value for the ​Vehicle is<br>x<br>​<br>1 = 0, x<br>​<br>2<br>​<br>=0, ​x<br>​<br>3 = 0, and ​x<br>​<br>4 = 0, e.g., (0, 0) position, tire angle of 0, and heading of 0. The ​Vehicle class assumes that any<br><br><br>invalid input values have been removed, so it does not do any error checking. The class does not permit anyone to update its<br>state, except by providing an ​Input​ object through the ​stateUpdate​ method prescribed in the header file.<br>4.3 Classes left largely to your design discretion<br>Anything you want to add to the interface for ​DataSource​, ​DataSink​, or ​Director​ is up to you.<br>The ​DataSource class keeps a vector of ​Input objects (control inputs), in order. Likewise, the ​DataSink class keeps a<br>vector of ​State​ objects (state outputs), in order.<br>The ​Director​ is used to pass ​Input​ values along to the ​Vehicle​.<br>Hint<br>​<br>: The ​bool data type is defined in C++, so it won’t work if you try to include the headers from previous projects. Use,<br>instead, the builtin type from C++ for bool functionality.<br>5. Recommended Functional Decomposition<br>In C++, global functions are a sign of a bad design. Rather, you provide methods inside the scope of a class. If you use global<br>functions for this assignment, you will receive significant design deductions. Just like in C programs, your main function<br>should be small. If yours includes lots of logic, rather than depending on the methods of classes, you will receive significant<br>design deductions.<br>5.1 Reading Control Inputs<br>Define a class method (not a global function) that reads all the control inputs from a provided filename. As you read them in,<br>don’t worry about how they’re sorted. The inputs will be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which class<br>this should be.<br>5.2 Sorting Control Inputs<br>Puts the control inputs in order of their timestamp. The interface for the sort function should be:<br>void​ sort ();       ​// performs qsort<br>If your algorithm does not perform quicksort, you will receive a deduction. Insertion and bubble sort are each unacceptable.<br>You should write your own sort routine, not use the sort routines in STL or any other library. You are, of course, welcome to<br>use other implementations to confirm that your qsort implementation is working, as part of your own tests. The inputs will be<br>already be stored in a vector in the class. I think you can figure out which class this should be.<br>5.2.1 Validating Control Inputs<br>This method should be part of the ​DataSource​ class. The interface for this method should be:<br>// should be called only after the vector is sorted<br>// returns true if the vector in Input objects is valid<br>bool ​validate ();<br>The vector of ​Input​ objects is invalid if any of the criteria from Section 2.1 are discovered.<br>5.3 Writing State Outputs<br>Define a class method (not a global function) that writes a vector of ​Output objects to a file of the provided filename. I<br>think you can figure out which class this should be.<br>5.4 Driving the Car<br>Once you have an (ordered) set of control inputs, you need a ​Director to coordinate the consumption of inputs, and save<br>each output. The ​Director will take the next Input (stored and sorted by the ​DataSource​) to the vehicle, fetch that<br>Output​, and store it in the output vector in the ​DataSink​. When the last ​Input is consumed, a duration of 200 ms should<br>be used. After simulating this ​Input​, the simulation is ended. In order to do this, the ​Director will “contain” a ​Vehicle<br>object, and decide how to interact with it.<br>Part of the assignment is coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in order to stage your design.<br>5.5 What goes in main, then?<br>In your main function, you should instantiate your classes, check your arguments and return the usage statement. Put all the<br>logic and error handling for file I/O, initialization of the ​Vehicle​, etc., in your methods as defined in your other files and in<br>the order that makes sense. You want your main to be very simple, so that if you want to reuse your code, you can do so<br>without a main function.<br>Generally, part of assignments going forward include coming up with and writing the pseudocode for this algorithm, in order<br>that your design can be performed in stages. To bootstrap this process, we provide as an example how to sketch an algorithm<br>is pseudocode below:<br>check usage<br>open input file, and output file<br>execute director<br>  while inputs<br>    execute input(s)<br>    save output(s)<br>write and close output file, input file<br>6. Alpha Submission<br>Your alpha assignment is to implement the Vehicle class methods, and turn in your ​Vehicle.cpp file to the dropbox called<br>Project 3 (alpha) on D2L. We will use your file with our own main function and test files, to check the behavior of each of<br>the ​Vehicle methods we prescribe. Use the same ​vehicle.h ​file given above and provided from the website, or be in<br>danger of your alpha not compiling.<br>As a note, you will have to complete your implementation of ​Input and ​State in order to test your alpha on your own.<br>Submit only your ​Vehicle.cpp ­­ ​do not submit implementations for Input and Output<br>​<br>, we will use our own. We have<br>already included ​Input.h and ​State.h in our ​vehicle.h interface definition, but you may need to include other<br>headers for standard C++ functionality in your cpp file. We do not recommend including headers for other custom classes in<br>your cpp file, since you will not be submitting those headers or their implementation.<br><br></font>

You can easily comment out a call to previously made procedures so you can test only the current procedure that you are working on.<br>You may use any string functions you want (e.g. strlen, strstr, etc).<br>You may not use the built-in String class.<br>In addition to the methods listed below, overload the following operators with all reasonable parameters (i.e. char, const char <em>, CSuperString &amp;): ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=.<br>NONE of the class methods other than the constructors or the assignment operators ( = and += ) should change m_pstrSuperString.<br>You must assign the value back to the class instance to make it permanent.  For example:<br>ssBuffer = ssBuffer.ToUpperCase( );<br>Minus one letter grade for any memory leak.  Minus two letter grades if there are a lot of memory leaks.<br>Minus one letter grade if replace with substrings doesn’t work correctly.<br>Minus one letter grade if self assignment doesn’t work correctly (e.g. ssBuffer = ssBuffer.ToUpperCase( ); ).<br>Minus one letter grade if you don’t solve the double call problem.  The following should display correctly:<br>printf( “Left( 2 ): %s, Left( 4 ): %s\n”, ssBuffer.Left( 2 ), ssBuffer.Left( 4 ) );<br>Splitting the code up into two lines is not the solution.<br>Add the following procedure to your tests and make sure it executes without errors.<br><br>void MuahahahTest1( )<br>{<br>CSuperString ssTest;<br>cout &lt;&lt; “Muahahah Test #1: “ &lt;&lt; ssTest &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br><br>Add the following procedure to your tests and make sure it executes without errors.<br><br>void MuahahahTest2( )<br>{<br>CSuperString ssTest = “I Love Star Wars and I Love Star Trek”;<br><br>ssTest = ssTest.Replace( “Love”,”Really Love Love” );<br><br>cout &lt;&lt; “Muahahah Test #2: “ &lt;&lt; ssTest &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br>I recommend you start with just the following methods, get those working and code, test and run additional methods one at a time: constructor, initialize, assignment operator, deep copy, to string and print.<br>Next, I’d recommend you get all the other constructors done.<br>After that, I’d recommend you get all the “to <data type="">” methods done.<br><br>// ——————————————————————————–<br>// Class: CSuperString<br>// ——————————————————————————–<br>class CSuperString<br>{<br><br>    private:<br>        char</data></em> m_pstrSuperString;<br><br>    public:<br>        // Constructors<br>        CSuperString( );<br>        // Parameterized/Copy constructors<br>        // CSuperString ssBuffer( “I Love Star Trek” );<br>        // CSuperString ssBuffer( 3.14159f );<br>        CSuperString( const char <em>pstrStringToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const bool blnBooleanToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const char chrLetterToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const short shtShortToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const int intIntegerToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const long lngLongToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const float sngFloatToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const double dblDoubleToCopy );<br>        CSuperString( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToCopy );<br><br>        // Destructor<br>        virtual ~CSuperString( );<br><br>        long Length( ) const;<br><br>        // Assignment Operators<br>        void operator = ( const char </em>pstrStringToCopy );<br>        void operator = ( const char chrLetterToCopy );<br>        void operator = ( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToCopy );<br>        // Extra credit for numeric parameters<br><br>        // Concatenate operator<br>        void operator += ( const char <em>pstrStringToAppend );<br>        void operator += ( const char chrCharacterToAppend );<br>        void operator += ( const CSuperString &amp;ssStringToAppend );<br>        // Extra credit for numeric parameters<br><br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const CSuperString &amp;ssLeft,<br>                                const CSuperString &amp;ssRight );<br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const char </em> pstrLeftSide,<br>                                const CSuperString &amp;ssRightString );<br>        friend CSuperString operator + ( const CSuperString &amp;ssLeftString,<br>                                const char <em> pstrRightSide );<br><br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind );<br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind, long lngStartIndex );<br>        long FindLastIndexOf ( const char chrLetterToFind );<br><br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char </em>pstrSubStringToFind );<br>        long FindFirstIndexOf ( const char <em>pstrSubStringToFind, long lngStartIndex );<br>        long FindLastIndexOf ( const char </em>pstrSubStringToFind );<br><br>        // Do not change original string.
