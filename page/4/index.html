All assignments will have to<br>be developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 using C# as the<br>programming language. No other languages will be accepted. This<br>assignment contributes to 10% of your overall grade. You must<br>demonstrate this assignment to your lab tutors during your scheduled lab<br>session in week 5. Note that you also need to submit your code on<br>BlackBoard before 11:59pm Sunday 28/08/2016.<br>This assignment is divided into 3 tasks:<br>• Creating an ASP.Net Web Application using Web Form (2 Marks)<br>• Performing basic calculator operations and converting the result from base-10<br>to base-2 (5 Marks)<br>• Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3 Marks)<br>Please Note INFS7204 students will have to complete all three tasks,<br>while INFS3204 students only need to complete the first two with 3<br>Marks for Task 1 and 7 Marks for Task 2.<br>• Preparation<br>• Before attempting to do this assignment, you should have a basic<br>knowledge of how to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 to create<br>ASP.NET Web Forms, as well as a basic knowledge of<br>programming with C#. Please note that you need to choose .NET<br>Framework 4.6 for your assignments. You also need to have<br>Windows 7 (or later versions) installed on your computer.<br>• Hints: Please be advised that the design and implementation of this<br>assignment is totally up to you. However, you may need to ensure<br>that you are familiar with the concept of ‘Recursive Functions’ and<br>defining ‘Global Variables’ to implement some parts of this<br>assignment.<br>• Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Free Download: If you would like<br>to install the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 on your own computer,<br>as a student, you can download it for free from the following links:<br><a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Default.aspx</a><br><a href="https://beta.visualstudio.com/download-visual-studio-vs/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://beta.visualstudio.com/download-visual-studio-vs/</a><br>Task 1: Creating an ASP.NET Web Application (2 Marks)<br>Create a Calculator Web Application with Web Form, which consists of<br>the following elements:<br>• Two TextBoxes for the user’s inputs<br>• A DropDownList for the user’s choice of operation<br>• Two Labels that indicate the result’s base system (i.e. base-10 or<br>base-2)<br>• Four TextBoxes for displaying the calculating results and counting<br>results.<br>• Two Buttons to submit the form and get the result<br>Your final application should look like the example below. However, you<br>may decide to design and implement this application more interestingly.<br>Please note that you are not required to validate the user’s input for this<br>assignment.<br>Task 2: Performing basic calculator operations and<br>converting the result from base-10 to base-2 (5 Marks)<br>In order to complete this task, you need to implement the basic calculator<br>operations (i.e. +, -, *, /). When user enters two numbers and clicks on the<br>Calculate button, the result of the operation should be displayed in the<br>base-10 output TextBox. Additionally, the result needs to be converted<br>from base-10 to base-2 system and be displayed in the base-2 output<br>TextBox.<br>For example, if user inputs 34+56, it calculates 34+56=90, the base-2<br>conversion number of 90 is 1011010. Please see the following picture:<br>Task 3: Counting the number of digits in base-2 number (3<br>Marks)<br>In this task, you need to count the number of “0”s and “1”s in the base-2<br>calculation result. When the calculation of Task 2 is done and user clicks<br>on the Count button, the number of “0”s and “1”s need to be displayed in<br>two output TextBoxs.<br>For example, as you can see in the following picture, the number of “0”s<br>in 1011010 is 3, and the number of “1”s in 1011010 is 4.<br><br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>java实现一个旅行售票管理系统，这个题主要考察学生的java基础知识，编程逻辑能力，类的设计和OOP知识，<br>功能点比较多，细节点也比较多。<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>COSC1290/1295 Advanced Programming / Java for C Programmers<br>School of CS and IT, RMIT University<br>Assignment 1 – Semester 2 2016 – UPDATED<br>Due date: 5.00pm, September 12, 2016<br>Introduction<br>You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java SE 7.0 or above.<br>This assignment is designed to help you:<br>1. Test your knowledge of basic Java concepts;<br>2.  Evaluate your ability to design programming logic;<br>3. Practise your knowledge of class design and OO constructs in Java;<br>4. Practise error handling in Java;<br>5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.<br>This is an individual assignment and worth 15% towards your final grade..<br>Academic Integrity (more)<br>The submitted assignment must be your own work. No marks will be awarded for any parts<br>which are not created by you.<br>Plagiarism is treated very seriously at RMIT. Plagiarism includes copying code directly from<br>other students, internet or other resources without proper reference. Sometimes, students<br>study and work on assignments together and submit similar files: this may be regarded as<br>plagiarism.<br>Please note that you should always create your own assignment even if you have very similar<br>ideas. Plagiarism-detection tools will be used for all submissions. Severe penalties may be<br>applied in cases of plagiarism, including loss of all marks or, in repeat cases, expulsion from<br>the course.<br>At any point, but especially during the scheduled lab-demonstrations, you may be required to<br>show and explain your design and code to any of the teaching staff.<br>General Implementation Details<br> All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be<br>printed to the standard output. There is no need to use files all.<br> If the input is formatted incorrectly the execution should stop immediately and an<br>appropriate error message should be displayed.<br> Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes<br>properly—i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer<br>than 50 lines.<br> Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your<br>coding style should be consistent with standard Java coding conventions<br>(<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html</a>)<br> Your programs will be marked on RMIT UNIX machines using Java SE 7.0. Make<br>sure you test your program on these machines before you submit.<br> Further hints, tips and details, including submission instructions, will be made via<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>Overall Specification<br>You will implement an electronic ticket for public transport, called MyTi (My Ticket).<br> A MyTi can be “charged” by adding credit to it: initially, a MyTi has zero credit; a MyTi<br>can hold up to $100 of credit.<br> Any attempt to add credit that goes above the limit causes an error message and for the<br>charge to fail.<br> Amounts to be credited to a MyTi must be integer dollar amounts in precise multiples of<br>$5.00.<br> Travel Passes can be bought using a MyTi ticket: a pass can be for either “2 Hours” or<br>“All Day”, and can be for either “Zone 1” or “Zone 1 and 2”.<br> Prices are as follows:<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1 pass: $3.50<br>o 2 Hour Zone 1+2 pass: $5.00<br>o All Day Zone 1 pass: $6.90<br>o All Day Zone 1+2 pass: $9.80<br> If you attempt to purchase a travel pass without sufficient credit on your MyTi ticket then<br>the attempt fails: no ticket is issued and there is no charge to your ticket.<br>Your system must handle multiple MyTi tickets, each with its own unique id—the id will be<br>used to identify which MyTi ticket is being used / charged / etc.<br>Journeys and Travel Passes<br>The MyTi system is designed to automatically combine multiple Journeys in a day by one<br>User into the cheapest Travel Pass that covers those Journeys. For example, if a User travels<br>twice inside 2 hours, then a 2 Hour pass is purchased. However, if the user travels again later<br>in the day, the 2 Hour pass may be turned into an All Day pass if that is cheaper than 2 2-<br>Hour passes.<br>Each time the user asks for a new Journey, the previously purchased Travel Pass should be<br>checked:<br>1. If the current Travel Pass is an All Day and we are in the day and the pass covers the<br>journey zones, then a new Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>2. If the new Journey fits inside the 2 Hours of the current Travel Pass, then a new<br>Travel Pass does not need to be purchased;<br>3. If the current Travel Pass is a 2 Hour and the new Journey is outside that time, then a<br>new 2 Hour Pass needs to be purchased.<br>TravelPass objects should store the information needed for all decisions described above<br>(e.g. whether to add a new Journey into an existing TravelPass).<br>To purchase a Travel Pass take a Journey, the system user must be prompted for:<br>-  The id of the MyTi card is to be charged to be used;<br>-  the day of travel, the start time and the end time;<br>-  the starting Station and end Station of the journey.<br>BONUS: The above means that users may spend more on Travel Passes than they needed to:<br>e.g., they may end up buying multiple 2-hour travel passes instead of one All Day pass. A<br>bonus task is implement logic that always results in the cheapest Travel Pass options:<br>1. IF the new Travel Pass means that all that day’s Passes would add up to cost more<br>than a All Day Pass—then all the Passes for that day are replaced by a single All Day<br>Pass; in this case the MyTi card is charged the difference between what has already<br>been paid that day, and what an All Day Pass would cost.<br>2. You have to do similar thinking about when different Journeys are in different Zones!<br>I’ll leave that to you to think about <br>If you try to purchase a Journey that requires a new Travel Pass, or an upgrade from 2 Hour<br>to All Day, and there is not enough credit left on their MyTi card, then the purchase of that<br>Journey must fail (with an Exception), and the user told they need to recharge their card.<br>Users<br>A MyTi ticket can be associated with one unique User. The MyTi ticket needs to store details<br>of its user, such as name and email address. A User needs to have access to their MyTi card.<br>Day and Times<br>To make things easier (and to run demos in less than real time!) you will type in the day and<br>times of Journeys (rather than using a System call to get them automatically). Using a “24<br>hour” time representation should make it easy to determine the length of Journeys. Note that<br>a Journey fits inside a 2 Hour pass if it ends before the end of the 2 Hour period. An All Day<br>pass covers all journeys that start inside that day and runs from midnight to 23:59pm.<br>Stations<br>Stations have a unique name and each Station can tell which Zone it is in.<br>Admin Functions<br>You also need to implement the following system administration functions:<br>-  On request, print all TravelPasses purchased on all MyTi cards. This list should<br>ordered by card id. For each TravelPass, list the Journeys that were in it;<br>-  Print usage statistics for all Stations: i.e., how many journeys started at each Station,<br>how many finished at each Station;<br>-  Create a new User: this requires input of a new id (the operation fails if it is already in<br>use), name, type (Adult, Junior, Senior), and email address.<br>Program Development<br>When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly<br>recommended that you build your program incrementally.<br>This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to<br>both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are<br>not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity.<br>Part A (1 mark): Extend existing code<br>Sample code implementing the outline of menu-based main program will be made available.<br>1. Design the TravelPass class to contain all data and operations it needs (e.g. the Zone<br>and Duration; Day and Start/End times);<br>2. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors. These may include: trying to<br>purchase a pass without having enough funds; recharging by an invalid amount;<br>invalid menu options or inputs, etc.<br>Part B (1 mark): Class Design<br>Define all the classes and interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you<br>should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may<br>mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer).<br>At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the<br>definitions, not all the code.<br>You will be submitting or demonstrating your class design in tutes or labs before the<br>due date. Details will be announced in lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Part C (3 marks): Main Program<br>Your main program should be in a class called MyTiSystem. (Of course, any class can<br>contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program contains a menu that<br>offers the following options in a loop:<br>1. Buy a Travel Pass using a MyTi card<br>2. Recharge a MyTi card<br>3. Show remaining credit for a MyTi card<br>4. Purchase a Journey using a MyTi card<br>5. Print all Journeys made using all MyTi cards<br>6. Show Station statistics<br>7. Add a new User<br>8. Quit<br>Since we managing multiple MyTi cards, we have to enter a card’s id to know which MyTi<br>ticket to charge for a travel pass.<br>Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality<br>Implement the core functionality of the MyTi system described above, except for the<br>complex decision-making around deciding whether a journey fits inside an existing<br>Travel Pass—i.e. in this version, just have the system buy a 2 Hour Travel Pass for each<br>Journey. You should be able to implement the rest of the MyTi functionality described above,<br>and run and test your system<br>Part E (1 marks): Include Multiple Journeys in Travel Passes<br>Implement the logic that decides whether a new Journey fits inside an existing Travel Pass or<br>whether the user needs to buy a new Travel Pass for that Journey.<br>Demos (1 mark each – 2 marks total)<br>You are required to demonstrate your progress and final solution to the teaching staff twice.<br>Details will be made available during lectures and on Blackboard.<br>Other (3 marks)<br>Marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity,<br>meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and<br>other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab<br>assistants, or with the coding mentors.<br>Bonus (1.5 marks each)<br> Implement logic, or “business rules”, for combining Travel Passes so that the user is<br>charged the cheapest Travel Pass that fits their day of travel. You are welcome to discuss<br>the logic and different conditions via Blackboard Discussion boards; however, every<br>student must implement the final Java solution by themselves.<br> There will be another bonus task announced later on for students that would like to<br>challenge themselves further.<br>Test Data<br>Your program MUST include the following test items: just create them in your main program<br>and use them to populate your data structures that keep track of all such items. These will be<br>used to test/mark your program so it’s crucial that you enter them. You may add further Users<br>and Stations if you wish, but you must add at least the ones below.<br> Users (id, type, name, email)<br>o lc, Lawrence Cavedon, lawrence.cavedon@rmit.edu.au<br> Stations (name, zone)<br>o Central, 1<br>o Flagstaff, 1<br>o Richmond, 1<br>o Lilydale, 2<br>o Epping, 2<br>Sample Test Runs<br>Sample runs demonstrating behaviour of the system will be provided on Blackboard.<br>Submission<br>Assignment submission will be via Blackboard, by 5.00pm, Monday September 12 2016.<br>You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each<br>submission will overwrite any previous submissions.<br>1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format).<br>2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Blackboard. Your progress will<br>be taken into consideration in marking. Further details will follow.<br>3. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program,<br>what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does<br>not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running<br>your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks.<br>4. There will also be demos for this assignment. You will be asked to demonstrate your<br>progress and/or explain your design. Details of the demo will be announced on<br>Blackboard and in lectures.<br>5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission<br>(do not submit any *.class files!). Your code must on under RMIT UNIX machines.<br>6. Late final submissions will incur a penalty of 10% per day. Submissions made 5 days<br>after the due date will receive no marks.<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>用python实现二叉搜索数的功能，在原来的模板基础上，增加题目要求写的方法，实现功能并且最后完成测试<br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>You may begin this assignment with the sample BST code.<br>Add the following functionality to the code:<br>1.  Modify the code so that each node stores not only a number (which is used as the sort value (or “key”) of the node), but also a string containing the name of a person.  So, the root node of a BST may contain for its data:  [40, “Wendy”], the left child of the root may be [18, “Carol”].   Modify all functions that this change affects.<br>2.  Add a function called “changeLeaves” which changes the person’s name contained in the leaf nodes to “Leif”.    Recall that a leaf node is one that has no children.  Your function should take one parameter, the root of a BST, and it should return the root of the (changed) tree.<br>3. Add a function called “countNodes” that counts the number of nodes that contain names starting with “w” or “W”.  Your function should take one parameter, the head of a BST and it should return the number of nodes matching the given condition.<br>4. Add a function called “printReverse” that prints all the nodes in reverse order.  That is, the node with the largest numerical value is printed first and the node with the smallest numerical value is printed last.  Your function should take as a parameter the root of a BST and it should return nothing.<br>5. Write a function that will convince the TA that your code works.  Be sure to explain what you are showing.  You should cover special cases such as empty trees.<br>What to Submit<br>Submit a single file containing your entire program.  DO NOT ZIP THE FILE.

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>C++完成一个互动的小游戏，需要按要求设计抽象类Game，Actor，Swan，Player等等类。对面向对象设计思想要求比较高，<br>游戏规则简单介绍一下，玩家上下左右逃生到出口，然后有苹果可以吃，也会碰到魔鬼被吃掉，赢的条件是安全逃到门口<br><br><br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Final  Project,  Part  1<br>Read the last page first!<br>Grading: You will NOT be demonstrating your final project! This means you must spend<br>more time on the reflections, design and test documents. The grader will not be able to ask<br>you questions. If the grader has a question that is not answered in your supplied<br>documentation then you will likely lose points.<br>You will create a program that will enable the user to move through a maze. The maze<br>will contain locked doors that require keys to be opened. Guarding the maze are roving<br>killer swans. The player isn’t completely defenseless as swans aren’t able to harm a<br>player who has recently consumed an apple. To escape the maze, the player must<br>navigate through the maze, swans, and doors until they reach a ladder. Each maze level<br>contains one ladder that takes the player to the next level of the maze until the final level<br>is reached. On the final level there is an exit instead of a ladder.<br>Baba Yaga is back! She has captured the player. Her soulless minion didn’t lock the<br>door correctly so the player can try to escape. She uses killer swans as the guards. Each<br>level starts with one swan. Baba Yaga knows the player has left the cell but can only<br>summon one new swan at a time. For every 30 steps the player takes, a new swan will<br>randomly appear on the current level.<br>The player will also encounter apples lying around the maze. The player can pick up and<br>carry up to two apples at a time. As long as the player has an apple in their inventory,<br>they may stop and eat it in order to render them invulnerable to swans for the next 15<br>steps.<br>Your code will implement this game as follows:<br>You will start your game with a single command line argument. This will be an integer<br>value that indicates the number of levels. The floor files will be named floor_# where #<br>indicates which floor it holds. Your program will always start reading with the first floor.<br>An example of running the game with a maze that has 3 floors:<br>./maze 3 (assumes name of first floor is: floor_1)<br>The maze is defined by a set of text files, each of which contains a single level.<br>Whenever the game starts or the player reaches a new level, that data must be read from<br>the appropriate text file. The first line of each file will have two integer values which<br>describe the number of rows and columns for that level. You must use this to create a<br>dynamic array of that size and then read in the data for the level. Perform input<br>validation on all characters in the file as you read them. Do not load the file and inform<br>the user there is a problem.<br>The following characters or symbols describe objects in the levels:<br>‘#’- walls<br>‘D’- door<br>‘L’- Ladder<br>‘P’- Player<br>‘S’- Swan (the starting location of the first swan)<br>‘K’ Key<br>‘A’- Apple<br>‘E’- Starting location for each level<br>‘X’- Exit(one way out)<br>‘ ‘- empty space (blank character)<br>You must concatenate the file name with the new floor number. You will not use an<br>array of filenames? HINT: This will require string streams.<br>You must display that level to the user. Then you will accept the following commands<br>from the user:<br>‘w’ move up<br>‘a’ move left<br>‘s’ move down<br>‘d’ move right<br>‘e’ eat apple<br>‘u’ use ladder<br>‘q’ quit<br>Each input from the user must be validated before any action takes place. After each<br>command, you will update the array, then print the current status of the game to the<br>screen. Each command is one “step” which you will use to coordinate movement and<br>summoning of the swans.<br>You will update the position of the player and all swans after every move entered by the<br>player. The K (key) and A (apple) symbols will be removed from the maze after the<br>player picks them up. The D (door) is removed once the player enters that space with a<br>key. To move between floors, the player must get to the space with the ladder. On the<br>final level the player must reach the X to exit the maze and make their escape.<br>The position of each Actor (Swan or Player) will not be stored in the array. It will be<br>stored in the Player or Swan object. When you read in the initial floor array the ‘S’<br>should be changed to a blank character. When you display the floor after each move you<br>will print the array, adding a ‘P’ or ‘S’ as appropriate for each Actor.<br>Movement- To move around a level the players must use the ‘W’, ‘A’. ‘S, and ‘D’ keys.<br>Your move function should prevent them from moving through walls, or a door if they<br>don’t have a key. If the player has a key then they can move through a door. Simply<br>remove a key from the player and convert the D space to an empty space assuming the<br>user has at least one.<br>When the player gets to a ladder space they climb it with a ‘U’ command. The E<br>character designates where the player starts on the new level. Time (i.e. the number of<br>steps) is reset on each new level. When the player moves from the starting space, the E<br>must remain. If a swan catches a player, their location must be changed to the E square.<br>After each move, the updated maze must be displayed for the user.<br>When the player moves into a space that contains a key (‘K’) they pick up the key to add<br>it to their inventory. When a player moves into a space with an apple (‘A’) they pick it<br>up. A player can hold no more than 3 keys and they can carry only 2 apples. If they enter<br>a space and cannot hold the key or apple it remains in that space. The player can use an<br>apple by eating it (‘E’). This makes the swans ignore the player for the next 15 turns,<br>decreases the apples the player has by 1, and takes an entire step/turn (i.e. they don’t<br>move that step).<br>Swans (10 points): The Swans will be similar to the Player, except they move randomly.<br>They cannot move through walls or doors. They will ignore apples on the ground. If a<br>swan is in a square adjacent to the player, the player will be moved back to the starting<br>space for that level. The swans cannot move between levels. For every 30 steps the player<br>takes, place a new swan at a random valid location in the current level.<br>Classes. You will need the following classes:<br>Game class- dynamic array for current floor, array of pointers to actors, int total#_floors,<br>int current_floor, function to read in floors from a file<br>Floor class- char [][] tiles, void print to screen, constructor<br>Actor class: ABSTRACT- int row, int column, char symbol, virtual move<br>Swan class (inherits Actor)- move (automated),<br>Player class (inherits Actor)- move (prompt for WASD), keys(s), hold up to 3 keys,  hold<br>up  to  2  apples<br>(You  will  need  a  function  to  send  the  player  back  to  the  start  if  a  swan  moves<br>adjacent  to  their  position.   Where  do  you  put  that  function?)<br>You must include a makefile and put all files for your assignment in a zip file. Each<br>class must have separate source and header files. If you do not do this assignment will<br>NOT be graded.<br>Grading:<br>•  programming style and documentation (10%)<br>•  read and create each maze level properly (5%)<br>•  the player and swans move through the maze correctly (10%)<br>o the apples are picked up and used correctly (5%)<br>o the keys are picked up and used correctly with the doors (5%)<br>o the swans send the player back correctly (5%)<br>•  create the Game class and object (5%)<br>•  create the Actor class (5%)<br>•  create the Swan class and object (10%)<br>•  create the Player class and object (5%)<br>•  input validation for commands and reading the files (10%)<br>•  reflections document to include the design description, test plan, test results, and<br>comments about how you resolved problems while designing and implementing your<br>program (20%)<br>You must include a makefile put all files for your assignment in a zip file. If you do not<br>do this assignment will NOT be graded.<br>Each class must have separate source and header files. If you do not do this assignment<br>will NOT be graded.<br>If your program segfaults at anytime, you will lose 20 points.<br>Design your Program<br>As always you should sit down with pencil and paper and sketch out the design. Develop<br>the necessary algorithms. Do a desk test, i.e. walk through your algorithms and code to<br>look for logic errors.<br>Nope! No keyboard yet! Now design your incremental development. Your program<br>should be decomposed into functional units. If not, go back to the previous paragraph.<br>Look at the pieces and decide on the order you should use to implement and test each<br>part. Reading the floor into your program and then moving an actor are probably good<br>places to start. Then add a level to test using the ladder. Once you have the development<br>you are ready!<br>Nope! No keyboard yet. ? Design and organize the directories for your project. You<br>should have a working directory. Maybe you need a subdirectory to hold the your floor<br>plans. Have you designed your floor plans? What is there to design? Maybe you can<br>have a floor that allows you to test only one function or command at a time? Be careful<br>with file names. The default first file always has the same name. If you overwrite one<br>then you’ll need to create it again. Always have one directory to save a copy of your<br>code as you get each increment to compile. If you’re paranoid (I know I am) maybe you<br>have more than one stash and on different devices?<br>Now, you’re ready to code!<br>The moral is: Always plan ahead and make it as complete as you can!<br><br><br></font>

The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 8th October 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time to<br>prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below.

These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select General Admission Tickets, Student Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user<br>selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is<br>advised and shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select General Admission Tickets or Student Tickets, they are prompted<br>to enter the Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required,<br>they are returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase<br>additional tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but<br>a purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A General Admission ticket costs<br>$13.50; a Student ticket costs $7.75.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of adult tickets<br>sold and the total number of child tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of adult tickets and the total number of child tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 8th October 2016.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of general<br>admission and student tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of general admission tickets and the total number of student tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1620 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

The two major tasks are outlined below.<br>Provided With:<br>You are given a file called Assignment1.java that contains a main method. Use this class to run<br>the code you write. Your code must work with this file; you cannot alter this file as a means of making<br>your code work. The marker will use a file similar to this to test the functionality of your code.<br>You are also provided two files called ThingToWriteFile.java and ThingToReadFile.java. These<br>classes are provided to make fileIO easier. Have a look at the code to understand how to use these<br>objects.<br>Two text files are included. One contains the country information (data.txt) and the other<br>contains the country/continent information (continent.txt). NOTE: Both of these files have a header<br>line!<br>On the last page of this assignment you are provided with an example output. Reference this for<br>text formatting.<br>You may assume all data is correct and that there are no errors in the data files (don’t worry<br>about exceptions, or validating inputs, etc.).<br>Stuff To Do:<br>1. Implement a Country class:<br>• The purpose of this object is to represent a country. This object will store some<br>important information about the country and will have a small number of simple<br>methods.<br>• This class will contain variables for the country name, population, area, and continent in<br>which it exists.<br>• You will need to write a constructor for the object. This constructor should take a name,<br>population, area, and continent as parameters.<br>• Write getter methods for the four instance variables (getName, etc.).<br>• Write a method called getPopDensity to return the country’s population density<br>(population/area).<br>• Write a single setter method for the population instance variable (setPopulation).<br>• Write a method called writeToFile which takes a ThingToWriteFile object as a<br>parameter. This method must write some country details to the provided<br>ThingToWriteFile object provided. Below is an example of how to print the details to<br>file (commas are important):<br>i. NAME, CONTINENT, POPULATION, POPULATION DENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada, North America, 34207000, 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a method printCountryDetails that prints some country details to the user:<br>i. NAME is located in CONTINENT has a population of POPULATION an area<br>of AREA and has a population density of GETPOPDENSITY<br>ii. Ex: Canada is located in North America has a population of 34207000, an area<br>of 9976140.0, and has a population density of 3.428881310807587<br>• Write a toString method which simply returns a string in this format (include a new line<br>character at the end):<br>i. NAME in CONTINENT<br>ii. Canada in North America<br>Test all your classes and methods before moving to the next section. Feel free to create other<br>helper methods if necessary.<br>2. Implement a CountryCatalogue class:<br>• The class should have a few important instance variables:<br>i. A final int called DEFAULT_SIZE which is equal to 5. This variable will be<br>used when the catalogue array is instantiated.<br>ii. A final int called NOT_FOUND which is equal to -1. This will be used as a flag<br>for some of our methods.<br>iii. A country array called catalogue which will store a bunch of countries.<br>iv. An int which stores the number of countries currently in the catalogue<br>v. A set of <strings> called continents. This set will store the continents. Don’t<br>know how to create a set in java? Look up the java docs, or just Google “Java<br>sets”. This set will make one of the below methods easier to implement.<br>vi. A <string, string=""> Map (dictionary) called cDict which will map a country name<br>to a continent. This will be used to make some of the below methods easier to<br>implement.<br>• Write the constructor (this gets a little complex). The constructor should:<br>i. Take two strings as parameters. One string will be the name of the file<br>containing the country information, and the other will be the name of the file<br>containing the continent information.<br>ii. Instantiate the instance variables.<br>iii. Read the country file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, create a Country object based on the text, and then add the Country to<br>the catalogue with a method called addCatalogue (more on this below). Be sure<br>to close the file when done.<br>iv. Read the continent file (with a ThingToReadFile object) one line at a time, parse<br>the text, and then add the details to cDict and continents. Be sure to close the file<br>when done.<br>• Write a private method called addCatalogue which takes a country as a parameter. This<br>method only adds the provided country to the catalogue. However, we may have a<br>problem, the catalogue may be full! For this method, don’t worry about adding<br>duplicate countries.<br>• Write a private method called expandCapacity that will double the size of the catalogue<br>array. This method can be called by addCatalogue if there is no more room for a new<br>county to be added.<br>• Write a method called addCountry which takes a country as a parameter. This method<br>should add the provided country object to the catalogue and update the continents set<br>and cDict map. This method can call addCatalogue. For this method, don’t worry about<br>adding duplicate countries.<br>• Write a method getCountry that takes an index as a parameter and returns a Country<br>object from the indexed location in the catalogue. This method should return null if the<br>index provided is inadmissible.<br>• Write a method printCountryCatalogue which simply calls the toString method for each<br>Country currently in the catalogue instance variable.<br>• Write a method filterCountriesByContinent which will print out all the countries from a<br>specified continent (just use the county’s toString method). This method will take a<br>String representing the continent we want the countries from.<br>• Write a method searchCatalogue which takes a String of a name of a country we want<br>to find. This method will return an int representing the index of the found country in<br>catalogue. If the item is not in the list, return NOT_FOUND. Print some sort of<br>notification to the user if the country was not found.<br>• Write a method removeCountry which takes a String of a name of a country we want to<br>remove from the catalogue. This method can use searchCatalogue. Print some<br>notification to the user whether or not the item was successfully removed or not.<br>• Write a method setPopulationOfACountry which takes a String representing the name of<br>a country we want to alter and an int representing the new population. This method can<br>call searchCatalogue. Print some notification to the user whether or not the item was<br>successfully altered or not.<br>• Write a method saveCountryCatalogue which will write the catalogue’s county’s to file.<br>This method takes a String representing the name of the file we want to save the details<br>to. This method can simply call the Country’s writeToFile method.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithLargestPop which will return the index location of the<br>country with the largest population currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method findCountryWithSmallestArea which will return the index location of<br>the country with the smallest area currently in the catalogue.<br>• Write a method printCountriesFilterDensity which prints out some country details if the<br>country lies within some specified population density range. This method takes two<br>integers specifying the range inclusively (low and high). This method will have some<br>additional bookkeeping. See the example output provided below for a demonstration of<br>how this output should look.<br>• Write a method findMostPopulousContinent which prints out the continent, and the total<br>population of that continent (based only on the countries in the catalogue) of the<br>continent with the largest population. See the example output provided below for a<br>demonstration of how this output should look.<br>Test all your classes and methods. Feel free to create other helper methods if necessary.<br>FAQ:<br>• Q: How do I compare strings? Can I just use == ?<br>o A: NO! DO NOT USE ==!!!!!!!!!!! Comparing Strings in Java is… very weird actually<br>(and actually the subject of some debate). Use a method called equals instead. For<br>example:<br>? SomeString.equals(SomeOtherString) will be true if the Strings are the same.<br>• Q: Why can’t I use == then?<br>o A: It’s complicated. I’ll go into this later in the course.<br>• Q: I don’t know how to do X?<br>o A: Try going to www.google.ca and then typing X into the big text box.<br>• Q: How do we use Maps (dictionaries) in Java?<br>o A: The idea is similar to python, but there are some Java-isms here. First, check out the<br>java docs for Maps (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html</a>).<br>You’ll need to import the library they are defined in. Also, try looking up examples of<br>people using them. Instantiating them is a little weird (more details on this later in the<br>course, for now you’ll have to just type the magic code) (HINT for instantiation:<br>hashmap). Iterating through them is different too; try Googling how to iterate through a<br>map in java.<br>• Q: How do we use Sets in Java?<br>o A: Basically exactly the same answer above, but the java docs are different<br>(<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Set.html</a>)<br>• Q: How do I parse a String in Java?<br>o A: Try looking up “splitting a string in java” with Google.<br>• Q: I swear I did everything right, but for some reason my files won’t open!<br>o A: This isn’t uncommon.<br>? If you’re using eclipse, try putting the .txt files in the project directory (the same<br>folder containing the bin folder, src folder.<br>? If you’re running from command line, try putting the files in the src folder.<br>Non-functional Specifications:<br>1. Include brief comments in your code identifying yourself, describing the program, and describing key<br>portions of the code.<br>2. Assignments are to be done individually and must be your own work. Software may be used to detect<br>cheating.<br>3. Use Java coding conventions and good programming techniques, for example:<br>i.  Meaningful variable names<br>ii. Conventions for naming variables and constants<br>iii. Use of constants where appropriate<br>iv. Readability: indentation, white space, consistency<br>Submit Country.java and CountryCatalogue.java. to OWL. Make sure you attach your .java files to your<br>assignment; DO NOT put the code inline in the textbox. DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR .class FILES. IF YOU<br>DO THIS, AND DO NOT ATTACH YOUR .java FILES, YOU WILL RECEIVE A MARK OF ZERO!<br>What You Will Be Marked On:<br>1. Functional specifications:<br>•  Does the program behave according to specifications?<br>•  Does it run with the main program provided?<br>•  Are your classes created properly?<br>•  Are you using appropriate data structures?<br>•  Is the output according to specifications?<br>2. Non-functional specifications: as described above<br>3.

Time Complexity analysis<br>[40 points]<br>1. Textbook Exercises 3.12, from (a) to (h)<br>[5 points each]<br>B. from ADT to implementation<br>[60 points]<br>1. Define an ADT for a two-dimensional array of integers.<br>Specify precisely the basic operations that can be performed on such arrays.<br>You may refer to the ADT for a list of integers, as shown in Example 1.4 on page 9 of the<br>textbook.<br>[20 points]<br>2. Specify an ADT for two-dimensional arrays of integers in the form of an interface (or abstract<br>class declaration) in Java.<br>Detail the functions, their parameters, and their return types.<br>Name your Java file  Int2DArray.java and save it in your  hw02 directory.<br>[20 points]<br>3. Write an implementation of your ADT for two-dimensional arrays of integers.<br>Name your Java file  Int2DArray2.java and save it in your  hw02 directory.<br>[20 points]<br>4. Note: the list of operations does not need to be all- comprehensive: you may focus on the<br>operations that you think are most important for working with 2D array of integers.<br>6/24/16, 22:15 Homework 02 - CSCI-A 343 Data Structures - Summer 2016<br>Page 2 of 2 <a href="https://homes.soic.indiana.edu/classes/summer2016/csci/c343-mitja/2016/homework/hw02.html" target="_blank" rel="external">https://homes.soic.indiana.edu/classes/summer2016/csci/c343-mitja/2016/homework/hw02.html</a><br>5. Submit all your files to IU GitHub under  hw/hw02/ .<br>Homework 02 Submission Instructions:<br>1. In addition to the above two  .java files, also submit a plain-text file named  hw02.txt in which you<br>answer Task A and Task B.1.<br>1. At the top of your  hw02.txt file, include “C343 / Summer 2016”, “Homework 02”, your full<br>name and your IU username (i.e. your IU account) in the  hw02.txt file.<br>2.  Make sure that your plain-text document is clearly readable by anyone; plain-text documents need to use either:<br>ASCII encoding (7-bit, allows no accents/smart quotes/etc.), or<br>UTF-8 encoding (capable of encoding all sorts of characters) ← preferred for plain-text submissions.<br>(…otherwise your output may end up garbled…)<br>3. Do not use any other document file formats: submitted files other than plain text (file formats<br>such as .pdf, .doc, .docx, .html, .xml, etc…) will be ignored.<br>2. all submissions need to be plain-text files, placed within a directory named “hw02”, which in turn<br>needs to be inside a top-level directory named “hw”, as explained above.<br>3. Turn in your Homework 02 by 11:59PM on Friday, June 24 th 2016, to your C343 repository on IU<br>GitHub C343/Summer 2016.<br>4. When you turn in your homework on IU GitHub, it is your responsibility to verify the contents of<br>your uploaded file, by double-checking the content of your repository on <a href="https://github.iu.edu/C343-" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.iu.edu/C343-</a><br>Summer2016.<br>5. Please do not omit your IU username from the content.<br>6.  P.S.: your username should in fact be your IU username, not the word your username…<br>Last updated: June 22, 2016<br>mitja ⊛ indiana ⋅ edu<br><br><br></font>
