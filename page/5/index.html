Submission system shuts off at 5pm.<br>Directions<br>Complete the following homework assignment using the description given in each section.<br>IMPORTANT INFO<br>tc.rnet will be down for maintenance during the course of the week of 10/3, it is anticipated<br>to be back up quickly but in order to be safe there is a temporary server created to work on hw2,<br>which will be taken down as soon as the former is back up and running. So in order to not lose your<br>code follow the instructions.<br>Logging in to the new server:<br>Putty: hostname =  test.rnet.missouri.edu<br>Terminal on a mac: ssh pawprint@test.rnet.missouri.edu<br>Notice the change of server, you will be logging into a different server (test.rnet.missouri.edu) and<br>not your original server (tc.rnet.missouri.edu).<br>USE FTP clients like FileZilla or WinSCP to back up your files to your local machine. The test.rnet<br>server is a temporary one and will be take down during the week of 10/3 after tc.rnet is back,<br>unfortunately we have no control over the timings, so whenever you code something make sure you<br>keep backing the file up immediately on your local machine. Like, every 15 minutes or once you<br>finish one function or whenever you quit out of test.rnet.<br>Once you get an announcement on BLACKBOARD from DHEERAJ, saying “tc.rnet is back and<br>running” move the local copy to tc.rnet server. Again, by using FTP.<br>After that, Log into putty / terminal again using<br>tc.rnet.missouri.edu as the new host name and continue the way you have been doing it all this<br>while and submit it from here only. You cannot submit from test.rnet.missouri.edu.<br>I really hope you know how to use ftp or file transfer by now. All the TAs have spoken at least twice<br>about it in the labs.<br>Submission information:<br>Submit the assignment by the due date using the similar submission command as used for labs<br>Please include your lab section in the file name.<br>This will work only when you are on tc.rnet.missouri.edu and not on test.rnet<br>Filename must be: sectionletter-hw2.c (Include your respective lab section)<br>e.g. m-hw2.c<br>$ submit <class> <assignment> <filename><br>$ submit CS1050 HW2 m-hw2.c<br>Purpose:<br><br> Learn to use multiple types of two-dimensional arrays for data input and access.<br> Use character arrays and strings and perform string manipulation.<br> Learn to develop a complex menu system.<br> Learn the importance of using functions.<br>Description<br>Thanksgiving Break is fast approaching, so, we hereby present Mizzou’s state-of-the-art online<br>ticket booking system, Joe’s Airline Reservation System. Which will be developed by you. This<br>application helps in reserving flight seats. This is done via implementing the 8 user-defined<br>functions as explained below.<br>Your program must print a menu for the user to select what he needs to do with the application.<br>There will be admin mode which requires log-in via a passcode. There will be an option for<br>reserving a seat on a flight. Third option is to exit the application.<br>A file templateHW2.c is attached on Blackboard which will guide you on how to start the<br>program and what are the global variables you need to use and how. You can follow that.<br>Comments and prototypes have been given for you to help you out in the process.<br>GLOBAL CONSTANTS and VARIABLES:<br>#define ROW 6 //for row length<br>#define COL 4 //for column length<br>#define MAX 25 // for strings<br><br>Functions to implement:<br>1. void initialSeats(char flight[][COL], int count);<br>The initialSeats function takes in a two-dimensional char array created in main. It will initialize<br>all array elements to the character ‘O’. ‘O’ symbolizes the seat on the plane is open and can be<br>taken. The int count variable is used to symbolize the number of people who already have a seat<br>on the plane, this is a random number generated and sent from main. In this function it will<br>randomly create and assign an index in the two-dimensional array with the character ‘X’ for each<br>person up to value of count. ‘X’ is used to symbolize that an element in the two dimensional<br>array is occupied. This will be used later on in the program. MAKE SURE TO SEED RAND in<br>MAIN. Below is the way to randomly generate the seats for each passenger to take. This<br>function should be called as soon as your program starts.<br>Keep in mind the possibility of the randomized index overwriting ‘X’, if it was already there.<br>You have to handle that case. Beware!!<br>int row = rand() % ROW;<br>int col = rand() % COL;<br>2. void displayMenu();<br>Prints the display options. Admin mode, Reserve a seat and Exit. This is the main menu.<br>3. void printFlightMap(char flight[][COL]);<br>The printFlightMap function is printing off a two-dimensional character array. Thus, printing off<br>the characters stored in each index of the two-dimensional array either ‘O’ or ‘X’. As noted<br>above the ROW and COL are #defined in your program, use them. For loops are your friends<br>here. Called in admin mode and during reserving a seat (specifically in seatReservation).<br>4. int loginMatch(int passcode, int adminPasscode);<br>The loginMatch function is called to compare the passcodes, the function returns 1 if both match<br>and 0 if there is no match. This is called in admin mode. Should prompt for the passcode entry<br>until the passcode matches. The adminPasscode is specified, everyone should use the same<br>adminPassocde, then compare that with the passcode user enters in main() when they wish to<br>log-in.<br>5.  int getTotalRevenue(char f1[][COL], char f2[][COL], char f3[ ][COL]);<br>Note: f1, f2, f3 are flight1, flight2, flight3, just shorthanded.<br>The getTotalRevenue function will take in all three two-dimensional character arrays created in<br>main and calculate the total revenue using the costMatrix two dimensional array. With each two-<br>dimensional array f1, f2, and f3, search for the character ‘X’ stored in them, upon finding the<br>index of the character ‘X’, use the index to reference inside of the global two-dimensional array<br>costMatrix (look above in Constants and Global Variables). While inside of costMatrix array,<br>add the value stored in the two-dimensional array with a running total variable (Hint use +=).<br>The function will return the total revenue earned thus far from seats reserved in all 3 flights. So,<br>you will need nested for-loops. This is called only in admin mode.<br>6. void flightMenu();<br>Prints the three flight options as shown. Flights to Miami, Nashville and Las Vegas. This is done<br>when reserve a seat option is chosen.<br>7. void seatReservation(char flight[][COL]);<br>The seatReservation function takes in a two-dimensional array and allows the user to reserve an<br>index on the two-dimensional array. Before any reserving is done, this function calls the<br>printFlightMap function mentioned earlier to allow the user to see the already populated two-<br>dimensional array for that flight. Then, the user is asked to enter a row and column to reserve a<br>seat. Additionally, this function will have built in error checking (look below at output<br>example) Once the user has inputted a correct index within [0, ROW) and [0, COL) in the two-<br>dimensional array, this function needs to check if that index entered is already taken in the two-<br>dimensional array with the character ‘X.’ If the index is populated with ‘X’, an error will be<br>shown to the user (look at the output below) and have them re-enter a new possible row and<br>column again. If the index entered is not filled with ‘X’, then assign that index with ‘X’, i.e.<br>changing the element from ‘O’ to ‘X’. Before the function ends, it will call the function<br>printFlightMap again and prints a success message.<br>Remember, rows run from 0-5 and columns from 0-3. Error check for this too.<br>8. void printMessage(char name[],char num[]);<br>//DO THIS, IF YOU ARE DOING THE BONUS<br>This function is called for each flight option after the seatReservation() is called. It takes in two<br>strings, name of passenger and the flight number for that particular case. Both are character<br>arrays (strings). For flight Cou-&gt;Miami number must be set as “MIA1050”, for Cou-&gt;Nashville<br>number must be set as “BNA1050”, for flight Cou-&gt;Las Vegas num must be set as “LAS1050”,<br>this must be done in main and the name and particular number must be sent to this function.<br>Once in this function, you will merge (important part) the two strings into third string and print<br>that as the e-Ticket as shown below and print a confirmation message.<br>Eg1: name is “Fred” number is “MIA1050”, your merged string should be FMrIeAd1050. Print<br>this as the booking confirmation number.<br>Eg2: name is “Guilliams” number is “LAS1050”, you merged string should be<br>GLuAiSl1l0i5a0ms.<br>Eg3: name is “Christopher” number is “BNA1050”, your merged string should be<br>CBhNrAi1s0t5o0pher<br>9. int main(void)<br>The main function will be doing all (most of) the function calls. In main, you need to create four<br>character arrays of flight_1[ROW][COL], flight_2[ROW][COL], flight_3[ROW][COL], and<br>strings name[MAX],flight_number[MAX]<br>adminPasscode= 105016; // everyone must keep this the same<br>Also, before you call initialSeats function on all the flights arrays individually, make sure to find<br>how many people already reserved seats. This is done by creating a local variable<br>seats = rand % 5 + 1 (this is your int counts in initialSeats function), rand()%5 +1 will give a<br>random number between 1-5; you only need to do this once. A menu system will be displayed for<br>the users to run specific parts of the program (See output below of what the menu system needs<br>to look like). Make sure to implement error checking for invalid input!<br>On the main menu, the user will see a display of options: The options are 1: Admin Portal, 2:<br>Reserve a seat on a flight, and 3: Quit. The menu will need to loop until the exit option is<br>chosen.<br>To access the Admin Portal, the user enters a 1, and then must type a passcode that will be<br>stored in a variable. Now, verify the passcode, call the loginMatch function (you should<br>compare) with passcode and adminPasscode to verify if it is an authentic log-in attempt. If the<br>pair match, that is, they are equivalent then it means successful log-in. Upon successful<br>verification, inside of the admin portal, call printFlightMap on each flight array and<br>getTotalRevenue (See output below). Declare these variables in main().<br>To access Reserve a seat, the user enters a 2. Inside of this portal, the user is displayed the three<br>flights that can be accessed to book a seat. (See below output). As always, verify the user input<br>for flight option (1-5). 2 character arrays will be used, name and flight_number. Once a valid<br>flight option is chosen. Switch to that particular case and ask for the user’s first name and store<br>it in name[] and store the flight numbers (MIA1050,BNA1050,LAS1050) in flight_number[] as<br>specified above for that flight. Then, send the corresponding flight array to seatReservation,<br>after successful reservation the user will be relocated back to the main menu. Then print a<br>success message using name and fligh_number, just to confirm the booking.<br>Must be done for each case (each flight).<br>Then, if you are doing the bonus, call the printMessage with name[] and that particular<br>flight_number[],. Note: flight1 is Miami, flight2 is Nashville, flight3 is Las Vegas.<br>Please go through Sample Output and the document clearly before starting out.<br>Sample Output<br>Character in bold are inputs from the user. Yours will vary but the outline must look similar. It is big,<br>don’t worry, but will help give you a better idea. I have run it twice completely, that’s why it is 10<br>pages.<br><br><br></filename></assignment></class></font>

You are required to meet with a TA within two weeks from<br>the due date to demo, and you receive an automatic 50 point deduction for<br>failure to do so. If you miss a scheduled appointment, you will be penalized 10<br>points for rescheduling within 1 day (24 hours), 25 points within 7 days (1 week),<br>and 50 points for anything outside of a week. Your job is to convince the TA that<br>your program works correctly, i.e. show your TA how to use/break your program☺<br>(90 pts) Program Implementation: Problem Statement<br>You are the proud owner of a virtual zoo that has places to house tigers, polar<br>bears, and penguins! You will write a Zoo Tycoon game using classes and<br>inheritance. Zoo Tycoon is a game where the user creates a zoo that has exhibits with a<br>number of different animals in each. Your zoo animals can be Tigers, Polar Bears, and<br>Penguins. You start with an initial amount of money in your zoo bank, and from there<br>you can begin to op.<br>Specific Animal traits:<br>• Age<br>o &gt;=3, adult <3, 1="" 2="" 3="" 5="" baby="" •="" cost="" o="" tigers="" $10,000,="" polar="" bears="" $5,000="" and="" penguins="" $1,000.="" babies="" have="" baby,="" babies,="" babies.="" average="" food="" you="" can="" get="" this="" from="" the="" user="" or="" set="" it="" as="" a="" constant="" for="" an="" animal.="" feeding="" of="" times="" per="" animal,="" animal="" example:="" $10.="" payoff="" 10%="" their="" plus="" bonus="" in="" (like="" other="" animals)="" 5%="" game="" flow:="" begin="" your="" zoo="" with="" specified="" amount="" money,="" e.g.="" 100,000="" dollars.="" buy="" either="" one="" two="" each="" to="" start="" zoo.="" time="" that="" is="" subtracted="" bank.="" bought="" starts="" age="" value="" 3.="" turn="" “day”.="" at="" beginning="" day,="" increases="" day="" older,="" pays="" required,="" so="" animals="" don’t="" die.="" after="" money="" bank,="" randomized="" event="" takes="" place.="" random="" events:="" 1)="" sickness="" occurs="" zoo,="" ask="" which="" will="" die,="" subtract="" budget.="" 2)="" boom="" attendance="" occurs,="" generate="" tigers,="" 250-500="" dollars="" add="" back="" into="" budget="" reward="" 3)="" born,="" having="" if="" there="" old="" enough="" be="" parent,=""> 3<br>• add number of babies born to that specific animal type to the exhibit<br>• else, reprompt the user for an animal.<br>• begin baby at age 0,<br>4) nothing happens.<br>After the random event, calculate your payoffs for the day based on normal visits for<br>penguins and polar bears, and possibly a bonus from a boom in attendance to see the<br>tigers!<br>Last, ask the player if they want to buy an adult animal, continue to the next day, or end<br>the game. If they chose to buy an animal, subtract that cost and add the animal to the<br>appropriate exhibit.<br>When you add money for profit or subtract money for sickness, the babies, or<br>animals with an age value less than 3 “days”, have a value of 2 times their normal<br>payoff or cost.<br>Requirements<br>• Each exhibit is a dynamic array of each type of animal.<br>• You must have classes for a zoo, animal, tiger, penguin, and polar bear.<br>• You Must Implement Inheritance: Your tiger, penguin, and polar bear must<br>inherit some traits and behaviors from the animal class, while there may be<br>others unique to the specific animal, such as a bonus for tigers.<br>• Every time you buy an animal, at the beginning of the game or during play time,<br>subtract that animals cost from the bank.<br>• Subtract the feeding cost (which depends on how many animals you own and<br>what kind) every morning.<br>• Have a random event take place during each turn and perform those bank<br>transactions correctly.<br>• Animals that aren’t “born” in the zoo start at age 3 and this age is incremented<br>every day. Animals younger than 3 (animals born in the exhibit) cost or earn the<br>zoo 2 times their regular amount.<br>• Make sure that the zookeeper doesn’t go bankrupt<br>• Reprompt user at the end of each day (at the end of the game play for loop) to<br>keep playing until they lose or they wish to end the game.<br>• No memory leaks<br>Extra Credit (10 pts):<br>TBD<br>(10 pts) Program Style/Comments<br>In your implementation, make sure that you include a program header in your program,<br>in addition to proper indentation/spacing and other comments! Below is an example<br>header to include. Make sure you review the style guidelines for this class, and begin<br>trying to follow them, i.e. don’t align everything on the left or put everything on one line!<br><a href="http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/spring2016/cs162-001/162_style_guideline.pdf</a><br>/<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>**</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br><strong> Program: zoo_driver.cpp

There should be no file extension after the file name<br>“README”. Your README should include the following sections:<br>Program Descriptions ( 5 points ) : Provide a high level description of what each of your programs do and<br>how you can interact with them. Make this explanation such that your grandpa or uncle or someone you know<br>who has no programming experience can understand what these programs do and how to use them. Do not<br>assume your reader is a computer science major.<br>Short Response ( 5 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim Questions:<br>1. In vim/gvim, what commands will indent N consecutive lines (starting from the cursor line) by one level<br>where the indent level is defined to be two spaces? This will take two vim commands: one to set the<br>number of spaces to indent with each indent level (default is 8), and one to actually indent N<br>consecutive lines. Likewise what command will shift N lines left (de-indent N lines)?<br>2. In vim/gvim, what command will indent an entire curly-bracket block one level, while the cursor is<br>currently on either the open or close curly bracket of the block? Likewise what command will shift an<br>entire curly-bracket block one level left (de-indent block)?<br>3. How do you open a new line below and insert (one keyboard key for both steps)?<br>Unix Question:<br>4. On the Unix command line, how can you capture (redirect) the program’s output into a file named<br>“output”?<br>Java Question:<br>5. How can you create an array of ints in Java and initialize it with the values of all single digit odd positive<br>numbers (inclusively between 0-9), all in one step/line?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see preview programming assignments; especially PA2’s writeup.  You will be specifically graded on<br>commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names, judicious use of blank lines,<br>not having more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-coded numbers<br>other than -1, 0, +1, using setters and getters, etc (see the style section of PA2’s writeup).<br>You will lose significant points if you have static methods or static variables for the Spin100 program<br>(except, constants are okay). Instead you should create getters and setters to change the variables for an<br>object.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>Start by creating your pa7 directory as usual. Then copy over the starter code from the public folder by doing<br>the following:<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7indrome.java ~/pa7<br>$ cp ~/../public/PA7-images/<em> ~/pa7<br>Program 1: PA7indrome ( 20 Points )<br>You must use recursion and implement the methods listed below or you will lose all 20 points for this<br>program. Also,  do not edit the main() method in PA7indrome.java as it will negatively affect your grade.<br>Write a command line application that checks whether an array of strings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a<br>word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forwards and backwards. The<br>program will take in a file as a command line argument. Each line of the file will be converted into a string,<br>where each string will be placed as an element in an arraylist then converted to an array (this part has already<br>been written for you in the main() method–do not edit anything in this method). Your task will be to then<br>determine if the array of strings is a palindrome or not (non-case sensitive). You will be using two recursive<br>methods to implement this functionality.<br>public static char[] reverse( char[] toRev ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: reverse the array of characters passed in using recursion.<br>● If the length of the character array passed in is 1, just return the array right away.<br>● Otherwise, swap the first and last characters in the array (#1-3 below)<br>● Copy the middle of the array into a new array and recursively call reverse on this new array (#4 below).<br>● Place the returned array back into the middle of the original array of characters, and return this<br>reversed array of characters (#5 below).<br>● Hint: you can use System.arraycopy() (look up the javadocs).<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>public static boolean isPalindrome( String[] words, int lo, int hi ) {…}<br>● Overall goal: determine if the array of strings passed in is a palindrome using recursion.<br>● Determine if the string at the low index in the words array is the reverse of the string at the high index in<br>the words array. To do so, you must use your reverse() function, after converting the string to a char<br>array and passing it in. This comparison should be non-case sensitive.<br>● If the string at the low index is indeed the reverse of the string at the high index, recurse on the<br>remaining middle portion of the array by passing modified values of the low and high index in the<br>recursive call. Otherwise, return false.<br>● This method must use ends-and-middle recursion.<br>You must use these methods as they are defined above or you will lose points.<br>We will test for edge cases when grading this assignment, so it is up to you to test your program thoroughly.<br>Similar to previous assignments, your output MUST match exactly to our sample output!<br>Sample Output 1: Not a palindrome (user input in BOLD)<br>For this example, the input file is named notPalindrome.

Player 1 gets to spin the wheel first. Player 1 gets to<br>spin until they have reached over 100 points or have clicked the “Finish Player 1” button. At that point,<br>it becomes Player 2’s turn. Player 2 then gets to spin until they have reached over 100 points or have<br>clicked the “Finish Player 2” button.<br>● Once Player 2 goes over 100 points or clicks the “Finish Player 2” button, the game ends.<br>● Whichever player is closer to 100 points wins. Once a player goes over 100 points then they’ve lost. If<br>both players go over 100 points then it’s a tie. If both players have the same score, then it’s a tie.<br>Example scores and their outcomes:<br>Player 1  70  120  20  100  100  95<br>Player 2  90  110  120  100  105  100<br>Winner  Player 2  Tie  Player 1  Tie  Player 1  Player 2<br>Implementation Details:<br>This program will have two Java source files: Spin100Controller.java and Spin100Wheel.java.<br>Spin100Controller.java will be the main controller which extends WindowController and handles the GUI<br>layout. Spin100Wheel.java will be the actual wheel object that defines what a wheel can do, how it spins, etc.<br>1. Setting up the GUI:<br>Start by first getting the GUI set up in the begin() method of Spin100Controller.java.<br>The top panel will have 3 labels:<br>● “Spin100” - You can customize the font of this label–don’t worry about whether the font is the default or<br>not! Just make sure your program doesn’t throw errors or have an incorrect layout / text upon start.<br>● “Player 1’s score: “ - followed by player 1’s score (initially 0).<br>● “Player 2’s score: “ - followed by player 2’s score (initially 0).<br>○ Note the space following the ‘:’ for each player’s score<br>The bottom panel will have 5 buttons: (make sure the text matches exactly).<br>● “Click to Spin P1”<br>● “Finish Player 1”<br>● “Restart”<br>● “Click to Spin P2”<br>● “Finish Player 2”<br>The wheels on the center canvas:<br>● The center of the window will have the canvas, similar to PA6. The height and width of the canvas<br>should be 840 x 660. Note that the canvas will not be resized during testing. On the canvas we will<br>be displaying two wheels (one for each player). In order to create the wheels, we need to initialize an<br>array of Image(s), using the images you copied over from the public folder. Make sure your images<br>are directly inside your pa7 directory, and not in a subdirectory called PA7-images.<br>● You will want to load the 20 images into an array of Images. To ensure you arrange the images in the<br>correct order, we suggest creating the following array. This will ensure you load the images in the<br>correct order and will also be helpful for scoring later on. Load the images corresponding to these<br>score values in the order in which they appear in the array. The array of images and the array of score<br>values will be parallel arrays.<br>private static final int[] SCORES = { 50, 85, 30, 65, 10, 45, 70, 25, 90, 5,<br>100, 15, 80, 35, 60, 20, 40, 75, 55, 95 };<br>● The wheel should always start with 50 in the center and should spin in a downward direction. This<br>means that when the wheel spins for the first time, the red arrow will first point to 50, then 85, then 30,<br>and so on.<br>● You will want to create each wheel by calling the Spin100Wheel constructor. Some parameters you will<br>probably want to pass to the constructor are:<br>○ The array of Image(s) corresponding to the SCORES values.<br>○ Location of the wheel (location of the top number). The center of the left wheel should be<br>horizontally aligned with the center of the left half of the canvas. In other words, you need to find<br>the x-coordinate that will center the left wheel in the center of the left half of the canvas.<br>Similarly, you need to find the x-coordinate that will center the right wheel in the center of the<br>right half of the canvas. The y-coordinate of the top number for both wheels should be 10 (make<br>sure the layout of your wheels matches the screenshots exactly).<br>○ Reference to the Spin100Controller so that controller methods can be called from the wheel<br>(this will be useful for setting the score after the wheel stops spinning each time)<br>○ Reference to the drawing canvas so the wheel can be placed on the canvas<br>The red arrows on the center canvas:<br>● The arrows are red-filled arcs with start angle = -15, arc angle = 30, height = 150, and width = 150.<br>● Left arrow position: (234.5, 186.0)<br>● Right arrow position: (688.5, 186.0)<br>Messages declaring winner on the center canvas:<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “Tie” at position (444, 5). The text should be blue, bold, and size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P1 Winner” at position (20, 5). The text should be green, bold, and<br>size 16.<br>● Create a hidden text object saying “P2 Winner” at position (808, 5). The text should be green, bold,<br>and size 16.<br>See the screenshot section below to see what all of this looks like.<br>2. Wheel Functionality<br>Because the wheels are animated, the Spin100Wheel class needs to extend ActiveObject (and therefore must<br>contain a run() method).<br>Creating a wheel:<br>● Each wheel needs an array of 5 VisibleImages (generated from the array of images passed in as a<br>parameter to the constructor) to store the 5 images that will be visible on the canvas at any given time.<br>● The location passed to the constructor is the location of the topmost VisibleImage. The next<br>VisibleImage will be 99 pixels below that, and the next 99 pixels below that, and so on.<br>● Each wheel needs a random double generator object to generate random numbers for the amount of<br>ticks to spin when the spin button is clicked (see more details below in the Spinning the wheel section).<br>● Don’t forget to save a reference to the Spin100Controller object to help with scoring.<br>● Set the number of ticks to 0, so the wheel begins stationary.<br>● As with all ActiveObjects, the last statement in the constructor should be start();.<br>Spinning the wheel:<br>● Initially, the wheel’s number of ticks should be set to zero. When a wheel’s spin button is clicked, the<br>controller should update the number of ticks so the wheel will start spinning. This means you will want<br>a method to generate a random number of ticks for the wheel to spin.<br>● One way to implement this is to have a method called getRandomTicks(). This method should:<br>○ First generate a random double between 0 and 1<br>○ Based on the random number, return the minimum number of ticks (50) + a number of<br>additional ticks, which indicates how many ticks a wheel should spin for. This is to allow the<br>wheel to stop on different numbers each time by randomizing where a wheel stops cycling<br>through the array of images.<br>○ If the random number is between 0 and 0.05, return MIN_TICKS + 1. If it’s between .05 and .1,<br>return MIN_TICKS + 2. You should keep adding one more tick until you return MIN_TICKS + 13<br>for when the value is between .6 and .65. From there you should subtract one less tick until you<br>return MIN_TICKS + 6 when the value is between .95 and 1.<br>■ Range of ticks to add (over the .05 increments) is<br>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6)<br>● After getting the random number of ticks, the controller needs to set the wheel’s number of ticks using a<br>setter method.<br>● To make the wheel actually spin, the run method will need to constantly check its number of ticks. If<br>the number of ticks is greater than 0, increment the index of each visible image displayed to the next<br>index in the images array; in other words, for every tick, shift the images down one. Once you reach<br>the last index of the images array, wrap back around to the beginning (Hint: think mod operator).<br>Then decrement the number of ticks left for this wheel to spin and pause to slow down the animation.<br>● At the beginning of each spin, the initial delay should be set to 1. Then when the wheel delay is less<br>than 20, the wheel delay should increment by 1 on every iteration of the forever loop. When the wheel<br>delay is greater than or equal to 20 and less than 200, the wheel delay should increment by 5. When<br>the wheel delay is greater than or equal to 200 and less than 500, the wheel delay should increment by<br>20. This will give the illusion of a faster spin at the start which eventually slows down and stops once<br>the number of ticks is zero.<br>● Once the number of ticks is 0, the wheel needs to call a public method in controller to let the controller<br>know that the wheel’s score has changed and that the Text object for the score needs to be updated.<br>● Some additional methods to include in the class would be setters and getters for the ticks, delay, and<br>score. This is so that the controller can call these methods and change the wheel’s variables’ values<br>when something like the spin, finish, or reset button is pressed.<br>3. Controller Functionality<br>You will implement Spin100Controller.java to handle creating the buttons and listening to actions performed on<br>the buttons.<br>● Upon start, only the “Click to Spin P1” and “Restart” buttons should be enabled. So in your begin()<br>method, in addition to setting up the layouts of the buttons, you should also disable the “Finish Player 1”<br>button and all buttons associated with Player 2.<br>● Once you have clicked “Click to Spin P1”, all buttons are disabled until the wheel stops spinning. Once<br>the wheel stops spinning, update Player 1’s score. Now that you have spun Player 1’s wheel at least<br>once, the “Finish Player 1” button should be enabled.<br>● As long as Player 1’s score is less than or equal to 100, Player 1 can choose to continue spinning by<br>clicking “Click to Spin P1” again, or click “Finish Player 1” to finish their turn. Once Player 1’s score is<br>over 100, the controller will automatically finish the turn for Player 1.<br>● Once Player 1 has finished, all of Player 1’s buttons are disabled and the “Click to Spin P2” button is<br>enabled for Player 2 to start spinning. The spinning process follows the same condition as stated for<br>Player 1.<br>● Once Player 2 has also finished, all but the Restart button should be disabled. A game over message<br>should be displayed. The message could announce a Tie, or announce that either Player 1 or Player 2<br>won (see screenshots for detail).<br>Summary of the buttons<br>● The Spin buttons: The spin button disables itself when:<br>○ The wheels are spinning<br>○ The player’s score has passed 100<br>○ The player has clicked finish after at least one spin<br>● The Finish buttons: Each player’s finish button is disabled until they have spun at least once. It is also<br>disabled when the wheel is spinning, as well as after they have finished their turn.<br>● The Restart button: This button is always enabled except when a wheel is spinning. Once clicked:<br>○ It changes the scores back to 0<br>○ It resets the wheels so that 50 is at the center again<br>○ The “Click To Spin P1” button is enabled again and the buttons are reset to the original state.<br>Implementation Requirements for Button Event Handling<br>To manage the behaviors of the 5 buttons, you must define 5 private member inner classes inside the<br>Spin100Controller class. Use your notes from class as a reference.<br>● Each private class must implement the ActionListener interface.<br>● The ActionListener interface enforces that each class has the actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) method<br>declared and implemented.<br>Having separate inner classes for each button is much better than handling all button events in one<br>actionPerformed() method. This is because there is a one-to-one relationship between buttons and listeners,<br>resulting in cleaner code that is less prone to errors.<br>Note: Remember to use getters/setters vs. directly accessing variables by name.<br>4. Sample Screenshots:<br>The start of the program. Both<br>player’s scores are set to 0,<br>with the arrows pointing to 50.<br>Only the buttons: “Click to Spin<br>P1” and “Restart” are enabled.<br>After Player 1 clicks “Click to<br>Spin P1”, the score for Player<br>1 is updated. The “Finish<br>Player 1” button is now<br>enabled after 1 spin.<br>Player 1 clicks “Finish Player<br>1”, and now only “Restart” and<br>“Click to Spin P2” buttons are<br>enabled.<br>Player 2 now clicks “Click to<br>Spin P2”, the score for Player<br>2 is updated. “Finish Player 2”<br>button is now enabled after the<br>first spin.<br>After Player 2 clicks “Finish<br>Player 2” The winner text<br>appears. The only button<br>enabled is “Restart”.<br>This is the case when Player<br>1’s score is over 100, thus<br>Player 2 wins.<br>In the case that Player 1’s<br>score exceeds 100, the<br>buttons “Click to Spin P1” and<br>“Finish Player 1” are<br>automatically disabled,<br>allowing P2 to begin.<br>If both player’s scores exceed<br>100, the game results in a tie.<br>Turnin<br>To turnin your code, navigate to your home directory and run the following command:<br>&gt; cse11turnin pa7<br>You may turn in your programming assignment as many times as you like.

Set the canvas width to 1000 and the canvas height to 660.<br>Overall Wins: 1 Point<br>Keep track of the overall wins with a message that appears at the end of the game:<br>Overall Wins P1: #, P2 @<br>where # is a non-negative number indicating how many times player 1 has won the game and @ is a non-<br>negative number indicating how many times player 2 has won the game. This message cannot overlap either<br>wheel and it should be horizontally centered between the wheels. It should be 200 pixels above the vertical<br>center of the canvas. The message can be in whatever color you would like besides black. In the case of a tie,<br>neither player’s win count should change.<br>Change Spin Direction: 1 Point<br>Add some new buttons and change the old ones so that each player has the option to spin up or down. There<br>should be a “P1, Spin Up” button, “P1, Spin Down” button, “P2, Spin Up” button, and “P2, Spin Down” button.<br>To clarify, spinning up is where the numbers appear to be moving up (so the 50 goes towards the top) whereas<br>spinning down is where the numbers appear to be moving down (so the 50 moves towards the bottom). You<br>can see the new buttons in the screenshots below. Disabling the buttons should still work the same as it does<br>in the normal portion of the PA, just make sure to disable both the Up and Down spin buttons.<br>Switch Starting Players: 3 Points<br>The “Switch” button is enabled only at the start of each round of the game. This button should be disabled in<br>the middle of a game (i.e. if a spin has occurred). This allows the player who spins first to switch with the other<br>player. For instance, if Player 1 was going to start first and the switch button is clicked. then the game will<br>restart and Player 2 will now start first. If the restart button were then clicked, Player 2 would still be going first.<br>Sample Screenshots:<br>If all extra credit features are implemented, this is the initial state of the program.<br>The overall number of wins for each player is shown when a round finishes.<br>Player 2 can begin the round of a game when “Switch” is clicked.<br><br><br></font>

The games have been<br>scheduled to begin on Saturday 3rd December 2016, competitors are busy training and now it’s time<br>to prepare to sell spectator tickets.<br>Your task is to design, develop and test a small application for recording ticket sales to this event.<br>Stage 1: Design<br>This stage requires you to prepare documentation that describes the function of the program and how<br>it is to be tested. There is no coding or code testing involved in this stage. A document template has<br>been provided for your use.<br>Requirements:<br>1) Read through Stage 2: Program Development to obtain details of the requirements of this<br>program.<br>2) Write an algorithm that describes how the program will operate.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced – must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. The algorithm must be structured logically so that the program would function correctly.<br>3) Prepare and document test cases that can be used to check that the program works correctly,<br>once it has been coded. You do NOT need to actually run the test cases in this stage; this will<br>occur in Stage 3: Testing.<br>a. All program requirements – base, standard and advanced, must be included, even if you<br>do not end up including all these requirements in your program code.<br>b. Make sure the test cases include checking of data entered by the user to make sure that<br>only valid data is accepted. If the user enters invalid data, the user should be informed of<br>this and given another chance to enter the data. NB: As we have not covered exception<br>handling, you may assume that the user will always enter an integer.<br>c. Test cases should be documented using a template like the one below. You may include<br>extra information if you wish. At this stage, the Actual Result column will be left blank.<br>Test Case  Expected Result  Actual Result<br>The user selects to purchase Tier 1<br>tickets.<br>The user is prompted to<br>enter the number of<br>tickets to purchase.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 3 of 9<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>Using the Design Documentation to assist you, develop a Java program that records spectator ticket<br>sales at the gate for the Federation University Australia Olympic Games, implementing the<br>requirements outlined in this section. These requirements have been broken into three groups:<br>  Base Functionality includes the minimal level of requirements to achieve the essential<br>components of this assignment. This group of requirements focuses on getting the code to<br>work and on using the programming constructs we cover in class. You can expect to use<br>constants, variables, loops, conditional statements and arithmetic operators for these<br>requirements and you should look for opportunities to use these wherever you can. You will not<br>receive full marks for implementing a requirement, even if it works, if you have not used the<br>appropriate programming construct to do so.<br>At this level, you can decide if it is easier for you to code everything within a single method, or<br>to modularize it straight away.<br>  Standard Functionality ensures the code is modularized, and that method calls are used to<br>ensure the program flows correctly. It allows data to pass from one method to another as<br>parameters. It also includes providing a running total of tickets within an order, which is not<br>essential for getting the program to work, but is useful information for the user to see.<br>  Advanced Functionality provides a challenge task, and is best left until all the other requirements<br>have been addressed. It requires looking at a Java API to find out how to use a class we have<br>not covered in the course, and using this to provide a countdown of days remaining until the<br>games commence.<br>All three groups require that you follow coding conventions, such as proper layout of code, using<br>naming conventions and writing meaningful comments throughout your program.<br>Base Functionality:<br>1. Display a welcome message when the program starts<br>  The welcome message should have a row of asterisks at the top and the bottom, just long<br>enough to extend over the text. Hint: Use a For loop for this.<br>  The first line of the message should read “FEDERATION UNIVERSITY AUSTRALIA<br>OLYMPICS” and be approximately centred in the row of asterisks by printing white space<br>first. Hint: Can you modify the For loop from the previous step to print the white spaces?<br>  A second line of the message should be blank.<br>  The third line should read “Developed by” followed by your name and a comma, then “<br>student ID ”, then your student id, then finally “ for ITECH1000 Sem 2 2016”.<br>  The fourth line should be blank.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 4 of 9<br>2. Provide a menu from which the user can select to Purchase Tickets, View Ticket Sales or Exit.<br>This menu should be repeated each time after the user has chosen and completed an option until<br>the user chooses to Exit. The user selects an option by entering the number next to it. If an<br>invalid number is selected, the user is advised and shown the menu again to make another<br>selection.<br>3. When the user selects the Purchase Tickets option, provide another menu from which the user<br>can select Tier 1 Tickets, Tier 2 Tickets, Finalise Order or Cancel Order. The user selects an<br>option by entering the number next to it. If an invalid number is selected, the user is advised and<br>shown the menu again to make another selection.<br>a. Should the user select Tier 1 Tickets or Tier 2 Tickets, they are prompted to enter the<br>Number of Tickets required. After entering the number of tickets required, they are<br>returned to the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that they may choose to purchase additional<br>tickets. The user may not choose to purchase a negative number of tickets, but a<br>purchase of 0 tickets is permitted.<br>b. Should the user select Finalise Order:<br>i. The sale is processed by displaying the number of each type of ticket purchased<br>and the total cost of the tickets in this order. A Tier 1 ticket costs $18.50; a Tier 2<br>ticket costs $11.25.<br>ii. A record is kept of the total cost of tickets sold, the total number of Tier 1 tickets<br>sold and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold. This is a combined total from all<br>orders; there is no need to keep a record of the number of tickets in each<br>individual order.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 5 of 9<br>iii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>c. Should the user select Cancel Order:<br>i. The order is cancelled and a message displayed to confirm this to the user.<br>ii. The user is returned to the menu from Step 2.<br>4. When the user selects the View Ticket Sales option, display the total value of ticket sales and both<br>the total number of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold across ALL orders.<br>Highlight this message display with a row of 50 asterisks before and after the message. After the<br>final row of asterisks, redisplay the menu from Step 2.<br>5. When the user selects Exit System, quit the program with a message to the user.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 6 of 9<br>Standard Functionality:<br>6. Update the Ticket Purchasing Menu so that a running total of tickets included in an order is<br>displayed until the order is finalized<br>7. Modularize the code, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods as<br>parameters.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>8. Update the Welcome Message to include a countdown of the number of days to go until the<br>games begin.<br>a. Use the GregorianCalendar class to manage your dates. You will need to import<br>java.util.GregorianCalendar to use this library.<br>b. The countdown must be calculated based on the number of days between the time the<br>program runs, and Saturday 3rd December 2016. It should also be possible to just update<br>the date within the code and have the countdown automatically recalculate the number of<br>days until the games commence.<br>c. There is no pre-defined method for finding the difference between two dates in this library.<br>You will need to develop your own, using the features of the GregorianCalendar class.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 7 of 9<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Using a copy of the test cases developed in Stage 1: Design, test the program you have developed in<br>Stage 2: Program Development. Document your results, including both failed and successful tests.<br>Note: Please do not leave out any failed tests. If your testing highlights that your program has not<br>worked correctly, then the failed tests help to demonstrate that you have been testing your program<br>properly.<br>To show that you have tested your program, include small (but readable) screen captures in your<br>Actual Results as well as any explanatory comments. Microsoft Windows includes a Snipping Tool<br>that is useful for taking captures of the relevant parts of the screen.<br>You may test your program in phases if you wish. Stage 2: Program Development provides three<br>separate groups of functionality in the requirements, working from the minimal level of requirements<br>through to more advanced concepts. Each of these groups can be tested individually.<br>Base Functionality:<br>This phase requires you to check that the base functions (displaying welcome message when the<br>program starts, showing a menu of options until the user chooses to exit, purchasing tickets, viewing<br>ticket sales and exiting the system) have been implemented.<br>Standard Functionality:<br>In addition to the Base Functionality, this section includes displaying a running total of tickets that have<br>been added to an order until such time as the order has been finalized. This new functionality must<br>also be tested.<br>If you originally wrote and tested the Base Functionality by including all the code in a single method,<br>this phase also requires that you modularize your code, and use method calls and pass data between<br>methods to ensure your program still runs correctly. This means all your code will need to be re-<br>tested to ensure that all the previous functionality still works.<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>This phase requires testing the code that calculates and displays the number of days until the games<br>comments in the welcoming message shown when the program starts.<br>Submission<br>Your program code and testing documentation should be zipped into a single file and loaded into the<br>Assignment Box provided in Moodle by the due date and time.<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 8 of 9<br>Marking Criteria/Rubric<br>Task<br>Available<br>Marks<br>Student<br>Mark<br>Stage 1: Design Documentation<br>Development of an algorithm describing how the program should function<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Logical structure  1<br>Documented test cases to validate program<br>  All requirements from the Assessment Details section included  1<br>  Data is validated to ensure user entries are appropriate and incorrect user entries<br>are handled smoothly<br>1<br>Stage 2: Program Development<br>A Java program addressing the requirements outlined in the Assignment Details section,<br>including appropriate use of loops, conditional statements, constants and variables:<br>Use of coding conventions throughout entire program, including readable and clear layout,<br>following naming conventions and including meaningful and appropriate comments.<br>1<br>Base Functionality:<br>  Display of a welcome message when the program starts  1<br>  Menu displayed until user chooses to exit  1<br>  Purchase Tickets option to select and order a user-selected combination of Tier 1<br>and Tier 2 tickets<br>2<br>  View Ticket Sales to display the total value of ticket sales and both the total number<br>of Tier 1 tickets and the total number of Tier 2 tickets sold<br>1<br>  Exit System to quit the program with a message to the user  1<br>Standard Functionality:<br>  Running total of tickets included in an order displayed in the Purchase Tickets menu<br>until the order is finalised<br>1<br>  Code modularized, correctly using method calls and passing data between methods  2<br>Advanced Functionality:<br>  Countdown of days to go until the games commence included in the welcome<br>message<br>3<br>Stage 3: Testing<br>Documented test results clearly showing all the testing that has been conducted and the<br>results of this testing.<br>  Testing of base functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of standard functionality<br>1<br>  Testing of advanced functionality<br>1<br>Total  20<br>CRICOS Provider No. 00103D  1623 Assignment 1 specification.docx  Page 9 of 9<br>Feedback<br>Assignments will be marked within 2 weeks of submission.

There should be no file extension after the file name “README”. Your README should<br>include the following sections:<br>Program Description ( 4 points ) : Provide a high level description of your program. Describe what your programs<br>do and how you can interact with them. Make these explanations such that your grandmother or uncle or<br>someone you know who has no programming experience can understand what this program does and how to use<br>it.<br>Write your README as if it were intended for a 5 year old. Do not assume your reader is a computer science<br>major.<br>Short Response ( 6 points ) : Answer the following questions:<br>Vim related questions (keyboard commands only – no mouse actions, ASCII characters only):<br>1. In vim, how do you move the cursor to the end of a line with a single command? To the beginning of a line<br>with a single command?<br>2. How do you highlight/select a line in vim?<br>Java related questions:<br>3. What does the keyword static mean in regards to variables?<br>4. What does the keyword static mean in regards to methods? Provide an example use of a static method.<br>5. What is overriding? Give an example from a previous/current assignment.<br>Unix related questions:<br>6. Using the cut command, how do you extract out only the columns 5 through 13 in a file named foo?<br>STYLE ( 20 points )<br>Please see previous programming assignments. A full file header for your README is not needed, but you still need to<br>put your name and cs11f login at the top. However, all other style guidelines apply to all the files ( e.g. over 80<br>characters apply to READMEs as well. )<br>You will be specifically graded on commenting, file headers, class and method headers, meaningful variable names,<br>sufficient use of blank lines, not using more than 80 characters on a line, perfect indentation, no magic numbers/hard-<br>coded numbers other than zero and +/-1, and use of accessor/mutator methods to access private fields (getters and<br>setters) where specified.<br>CORRECTNESS ( 70 points )<br>You are asked to create an interactive 3 x 3 puzzle game for pre-schoolers. The player has to drag the puzzle pieces on<br>the right to the correct location on the left to form a complete image. This assignment does NOT involve ActiveObjects<br>or require a paint() method. The correctness of this assignment is based on meeting the required functionalities listed<br>below.<br>Part 0: Overview  BoardPieces  PuzzlePieces<br>We have a 3 x 3 puzzle, which gives us 9 puzzle pieces that are movable on the right. They can be dragged<br>anywhere on the canvas, but not off the canvas. On the left, we have a 3 x 3 board. After a puzzle piece is dragged<br>onto its correct location, the puzzle piece is “locked” into the board and is no longer movable.<br>The reason “locked” is in quotes is because the puzzle piece is actually not locked. We created this illusion by<br>having two different types of Pieces here: PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece. When a PuzzlePiece (movable piece on the<br>right) is dragged onto a BoardPiece (fixed piece on the left), your program will do some verification to see if they<br>match. If so, it’s going to hide the PuzzlePiece and reveal the BoardPiece with the same image as the PuzzlePiece.<br>So it may seem like the PuzzlePiece is locked in place, but it’s actually a different BoardPiece that’s displayed on<br>the canvas. Now that we know the basic idea/hack behind this game, how do we implement it?<br>Part 1: Useful Interfaces<br>Take advantage of interfaces! We have two different kinds of Piece types here, but they share a lot in common.<br>We’ll implement the Piece interface later in PuzzlePiece and BoardPiece classes.<br>1. The Highlightable interface is used to draw borders and highlights around each piece:<br>import java.awt.Color;<br>public interface Highlightable {<br>public abstract void showHighlight( Color color );<br>public abstract void hideHighlight();<br>}<br>2. The Hideable interface is used to hide and show pieces:<br>public interface Hideable {<br>public abstract void show();<br>public abstract void hide();<br>}<br>3. The Piece interface, which extends the two interfaces above and includes a few other methods:<br>import objectdraw.<em>;<br>public interface Piece extends Highlightable, Hideable {<br>public abstract boolean contains(Location point);<br>public abstract boolean equals(Object o);<br>public abstract Location getCenter();<br>public abstract int getId();<br>public abstract void move(double dx, double dy);<br>}<br>Part 2: Piece Classes<br>You will create 2 Piece classes: class BoardPiece and class PuzzlePiece.<br>Each of these classes will implement the Piece interface. For example:<br>public class BoardPiece implements Piece { … }<br>Each Piece class will hold the specifics about that piece:<br>•  the piece image (a VisibleImage created from passing an Image object to its constructor)<br>•  ID (integer indexed from 0 to 8 in order of left to right and top to bottom, each ID represents a piece with<br>a distinct image)<br>•  center (a Location object that represents the center point of this piece)<br>•  borders/highlights (PuzzlePiece (the movable pieces on the right) has one black FramedRect object right<br>on top of the edge of the image and wraps around it as the border. BoardPiece (the fixed pieces on the<br>left) has two FramedRect objects, one right on top of the edge of the image, and one that’s inset by 1px,<br>so it creates a thicker outline. When the game first starts, BoardPiece should only display the outer<br>highlight as black.)<br>Thus, the constructor for BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece should be identical. For example:<br>public BoardPiece(Image img, int id, Location loc, DrawingCanvas canvas) { … }<br>Each Piece class will also implement the methods from the Piece interface.<br>•  showHighlight() and hideHighlight() can access and change the visibility of the FramedRect objects that<br>highlight each piece.<br>•  show() in PuzzlePiece should show the image and the black FramedRect highlight. show() in BoardPiece<br>should just show the image. We will call showHighlight() when we want to display the green highlight to<br>indicate the puzzle piece is in the correct spot on the board (more on this later).<br>•  hide() in PuzzlePiece should hide the image and the highlight. hide() in BoardPiece does nothing unless<br>you plan to implement the extra credit.<br>•  contains() in PuzzlePiece determines whether some point is contained in the VisibleImage associated with<br>that piece (Hint: use VisibleImage’s contains() method). contains() method in BoardPiece requires a little<br>more logic. If you are giving this puzzle to someone, you don’t want him/her to solve this so quickly by just<br>dragging the PuzzlePieces close enough to the BoardPieces so they get locked in automatically. If you are<br>the player, you also don’t want to be forced to drag the PuzzlePiece so your cursor/PuzzlePiece falls<br>perfectly within the BoardPiece. So what we are going to do here is add a different check: instead of<br>passing the point where the cursor is, we are going to pass the center of the PuzzlePiece we are dragging<br>to contains(). If the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the<br>BoardPiece, then we can say “the point is contained” in the BoardPiece. What we are really checking here<br>is whether the center of the PuzzlePiece is contained in the 50 x 50px square in the BoardPiece.<br>•  equals() checks if two Pieces are equal (for example, does the PuzzlePiece match with the BoardPiece in<br>the board grid?). This is done by checking the unique ID (0 - 8) we assigned to each piece.<br>•  getId() returns the unique ID of the Piece.<br>•  getCenter() returns the center of the Piece.<br>•  move() in BoardPiece should do nothing since BoardPieces are fixed. You would have to add some<br>implementation if you decide to do extra credit. move() in PuzzlePiece is in charge of moving the<br>PuzzlePiece around. There’s one tricky thing about this method… you need to make sure that the<br>PuzzlePieces cannot be dragged off the canvas. More specifically, the center of PuzzlePiece should not be<br>able to move off the canvas.<br>Part 3: class Puzzle<br>Now we’ve set up the building blocks for this game, we can start implementing the controller Puzzle class. Class<br>Puzzle should extend WindowController and include main() that starts a new instance of Acme.MainFrame. The<br>canvas size should be 735 by 380 pixels.<br>Part 3a: Get Images<br>Nine 100px x 100px puzzle piece images are available for you in ~/../public/PA5-images/. They are numbered<br>from p0 to p8 (e.g. p0.jpg, p1.jpg, …).<br>In order to load these images into the program, use the getImage() method in class Puzzle (the main GUI controller<br>that implements WindowController). For example:<br>getImage(“p0.jpg”);<br>We need to load 9 images into an Image array (array of Image objects). Instead of hardcoding 9 lines of<br>getImage(), we can do this in a loop using some string concatenation. getImage() will return an Image object. You<br>should pass each Image object as an actual argument to each the of Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, and inside<br>that Board/PuzzlePiece’s constructor, make a VisibleImage object based on the Image object.<br>Part 3b: Layout<br>The main Puzzle class will also layout the BoardPieces and the PuzzlePieces as seen in the earlier screenshots.<br>Again, instead of hardcoding 18 different locations, we are going to use two arrays to store Locations, one for<br>BoardPieces and one for PuzzlePieces. The good news is that the constants and the formulas of calculating these<br>Locations have been worked out for you:<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_COL = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PIECES_PER_ROW = 3; // can be changed to expand the puzzle<br>private static final int PUZZLE_SPACING = 20; // num of px between PuzzlePieces<br>private static final int PUZZLE_OFFSET = 355; // offset from left side of canvas<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_X = 25; // left margin of the board<br>private static final int BOARD_MARGIN_Y = 40; // top margin of the board<br>private static final int SIDE_LENGTH = 100; // side length of each Piece<br>BoardPiece with index i is located at<br>x = BOARD_MARGIN_X + SIDE_LENGTH </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = BOARD_MARGIN_Y + SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>PuzzlePiece with index i is located at<br>x = PUZZLE_OFFSET + PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL + 1)<br>+ SIDE_LENGTH <em> (i % PIECES_PER_COL)<br>and<br>y = PUZZLE_SPACING </em> (i / PIECES_PER_ROW + 1) + SIDE_LENGTH * (i / PIECES_PER_ROW).<br>These x and y coordinates represent the upper left corners of the VisibleImage in each Piece. You can check the<br>math if you are curious what’s up with all these mods and divides.<br>Before you place all the Pieces onto the canvas, add a Text object as the winning message “YOU WON!” at x = 355<br>and y = the Y value of the fourth BoardPiece. It should have font size of 55 in bold and green. Hide the winning<br>message for now, and we will come back to it later (the order of creation matters here because it affects the<br>drawing arrangement).<br>Now let’s put the Pieces onto the canvas. Placing the BoardPieces is easy. We already have the Image array and<br>the Location array for BoardPieces. We just need another array of the interface type Piece to keep track of the<br>BoardPieces. We will go through the Image array and the Location array and create BoardPieces in order. Each<br>BoardPiece ID should match with its index in the Piece array.<br>For PuzzlePieces though, we want to pick one of the nine images randomly. We can do so by implementing a<br>method called getRandomPuzzlePiece() that takes in Location and DrawingCanvas. This method will use a<br>RandomIntGenerator that randomly generates an integer between 0 and 8. We will first check if this randomly<br>generated index represents an image that’s already used. If so, we want to get another random index until we find<br>an unused one, because every PuzzlePiece should have a unique image. Once we’ve found an unused index, we<br>can create a new PuzzlePiece. We are going to return this Piece we randomly created and store a reference to it in<br>a Piece array. We’ll do this 9 times to place all the PuzzlePieces. Note that the ID in PuzzlePiece is NOT associated<br>with its random array index but with the unique piece image.<br>To avoid using magic numbers like 8, you can create a MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES constant. In our case,<br>MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES is 9. When we need to use this as an index, we can do MAX_NUM_OF_PIECES – 1, which<br>takes care of the offset from zero-based indexing.<br>Hooray! Now you should be able to see all the BoardPieces and PuzzlePieces on your canvas. But we are not quite<br>there yet. Your GUI controller (class Puzzle) needs to handle all the mouse events and the logic of verifying the<br>Pieces. Take a break before you proceed. :)<br>Part 3c: Dragging PuzzlePiece<br>By PA5, you should be pretty familiar with onMousePress(), onMouseDrag(), and onMouseRelease(). The logic is<br>still the same. You want to keep a reference to lastPoint and find the difference between lastPoint and current<br>point. You do need to do one additional thing here, and that is keep track of which PuzzlePiece is being grabbed.<br>You can do so by looping through the Piece array holding all the PuzzlePieces and find which PuzzlePiece contains<br>the point.<br>Part 3d: Verifying PuzzlePiece<br>Hmmm… Where should you be checking if the puzzle piece has been placed (not while still dragging) in the correct<br>spot on the board to the left? There’s only one place, and I’ll let you answer it (HINT: it is NOT in onMouseDrag()).<br>But I’ll walk you through how to verify a puzzle piece has been placed correctly. Remember many words ago, we<br>said if the center of the PuzzlePiece is within a 50 by 50 pixels square in the center of the BoardPiece, we can say<br>the PuzzlePiece is “contained” in the BoardPiece (this check is already done in contains()). Here, the methods<br>you’ve implemented in BoardPiece and PuzzlePiece come in handy. You can use getCenter() to get the center of<br>the grabbed puzzle piece and call contains() on every BoardPiece in a loop. If we were able to find a BoardPiece<br>that contains the center of the grabbed puzzle piece AND they are equal (matching IDs), then we can go ahead and<br>“lock” this Piece. Again, the “locking”<br>is done by hiding the grabbed puzzle<br>piece and showing the BoardPiece as<br>described in the overview. Don’t<br>forget to show green highlights<br>around the BoardPiece to let the pre-<br>schoolers know that they’ve placed<br>the Piece correctly!<br>Part 3e: Verifying Victory<br>Almost there… I can hear the sound of victory! How can we check if the puzzle is finished? One easy way to do this<br>is having yet another array. This array will contain booleans that represent whether a Piece has been “locked”.<br>Since the Pieces have unique IDs from 0 to 8, we can just use those as indices and mark them true as they get<br>“locked”. The game is done after every element in this boolean array becomes true. At the moment of victory, you<br>should hide the green highlights around each BoardPiece and display a seamless image composed of 9 pieces. You<br>should also show the winning message.<br>And yaaaaaay, that’s the end of this assignment.<br>Running<br>To compile your Puzzle game, type this into the terminal:<br>&gt; javac -cp ./Acme.jar:./objectdraw.jar:.

Dragging after Winning [2.5pts total]<br>After the user has finished the game, the 9 BoardPieces should look like a complete image of an aerial view of UC<br>San Diego. As a part of extra credit, enable dragging this “image” around the canvas (really, you are dragging these<br>9 pieces together). You will have to change the move() method inside BoardPiece.

Clicking after Winning [2.5pts total]<br>The pre-schoolers just can’t stop playing your puzzle again and again, but their teacher is not always there to<br>restart the game for them. To make it easier for them, add a feature so that clicking anywhere on the complete<br>image of the puzzle will restart the game. You’d want to add an onMouseClick() and reinitialize many things (Hint:<br>You don’t need to reinitialize the Image array or the Text object). Clicking on the white space should do nothing.<br>NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED!<br>START EARLY!<br>…and  HAVE FUN!<br><br><br></font>

        <font size="4"><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>基本思路:<br>判断逻辑表达式的真假,根据优先级从里往外一层一层的解表达式,最后的到表达式的值<br>注意点:<br>题目中符号的值是给定的,不用自己定义,在或与非结合的时候表达式的值的计算要注意<br><strong>Requirement</strong><br><br>Assignment 3<br>Instructor: Musard Balliu<br>October, 2016<br>In this assignment, you will implement an object-oriented application to deter-<br>mine the truth value of boolean circuits. A boolean circuit is a logical formula<br>consisting of boolean variables a,b,x,y,···, negation (NOT, written as !), con-<br>junction (AND, written as ∧) and disjunction (OR, written as ∨). For example,<br>(a ∧ b) ∨ (c ∨ !(b)) is a boolean circuit on variables a,b and c. The truth value<br>of a boolean circuit is either true or false, and it can be determined when-<br>ever the truth values of all variables of the circuit are fixed. For example, if<br>a = true,b = false and c = true, the truth value of the boolean circuit above<br>is true. An assignment of truth values to the boolean variables of a circuit is<br>called a truth assignment for that circuit.<br>Two circuits are equivalent iff they have the same truth value for all possible<br>truth assignments of their variables. For example, the circuit a ∧ a is equivalent<br>to the circuit a, and the circuit !(a∨b) is equivalent to the circuit !(a)∧!(b). The<br>circuit a∧b is not equivalent to the circuit a∨b, since, for instance, if a = false<br>and b = true, the truth value of the first circuit is false, and the truth value of<br>the second circuit is true.<br>The free variables of a circuit are the variables used in that circuit (without<br>repetitions). For example, the free variables of the circuit (x ∧ y) ∨ !(x) are x<br>and y.<br>The task<br>In this assignment, you are given two classes, Assignment.java and Circuit.java,<br>and they are already implemented for you. In particular, the method equals(),<br>implemented in Circuit.java, allows to determine whether or not two circuits are<br>equivalent.<br>1<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>The goal of this assignment is to complete the implementation of subclasses<br>Variable.java, Not.java, And.java e Or.java of the superclass Circuit.java. Con-<br>cretely, you have to complete the implementation of the methods isTrueIn(),<br>freeVariables() and toString() for each subclass (and a few other methods,<br>constructors and instance variables). The methods have the following specifica-<br>tion:<br>• isTrueIn(Assignment a) determines whether a circuit is true for a given<br>assignment a.<br>• freeVariables() returns an array containing the free variables of a cir-<br>cuit, in any order and without repetitions.<br>• toString() returns a string representation of the circuit.<br>You also have to implement a main class, CircuitMain.java, that creates two<br>circuits !(a ∧ b) and !(a) ∨ !(b) and checks whether or not they are equivalent.<br>Finally, you have to create n random circuits of maximal depth 5, calculate their<br>truth value, and print to the console both the (string representation of) circuits<br>and their truth values, for a given positive integer n provided as input by the<br>user.<br>In order to get a VG, you must implement a graphical user interface (GUI) that<br>handles the features in class CircuitMain.java.<br>The specification of each method is provided as commented java files, included<br>in the following sections and available for download from<br><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.cse.chalmers.se/</a> musard/teaching/programming2016/dit948-2016/Assign3 2016.zip<br>The interface, example session<br>The set of all variables used in a random circuit is ”v”,”w”,”x”,”y”,”z”,”a”,”b”,<br>of which the variables ”v”,”y”,”a” are true in the assignment (and, conse-<br>quently, the remaining variables are false).

However, you can implement additional methods, if needed.<br>Classes Assignment.java and Circuit.java can be used as APIs and you are not<br>allowed to change their implementation.<br>8<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>The GUI provided earlier is just an example. Feel free to implement your own<br>fancy version, so long as it contains the basic tasks as required by the assignment.<br>Grading<br>• To get a G, you do not need to implement a graphical user interface.<br>• To get a V G, it is necessary implement all tasks in the assignment.<br>Note that these requirements are necessary, but not sufficient, to get the<br>respective grades (see Administrative matters).<br>Administrative matters<br>Strive for readable code with appropriate comments! While the ultimate test of<br>a program is that it does what it is supposed to do, we should be able to<br>read the program and understand it.<br>The assignment is to be completed in groups of two students. (Groups of different<br>size should first be agreed with the course instructor.)<br>Solutions must be uploaded to the GUL system by 23:55 on October 19.<br>Please note: The submission must be made via GUL. It’s no good sending<br>it to me via email, either before or after the deadline!<br>Only Java source files should be uploaded, no class files. Your Java files should<br>be put in a zip-archive with the following name:<br>assign3_author1_author2.zip<br>where author1, author2 are the surnames (family names) of the group members.<br>You must also supply a README-file (README.txt) containing the names of<br>the authors and their social security numbers, together with a brief statement<br>about each author’s contribution. For example, “author1 has been responsible for<br>user input and author2 for the program logic”. A statement such as “All authors<br>have contributed equally to all aspects of the program” is not acceptable.<br>Note that each author must submit individually via the GUL (even though<br>it is the same program!). Only students who submit via the GUL can be graded.<br>All comments etc. will be posted on the course web page.<br>9<br>DIT948-2016, Assignment 3<br>Once the deadline has passed, each group must explain solutions to the TAs<br>during the first Thursday supervision session. Exceptions are to be agreed<br>with the instructor and the TAs. Group members are expected to know and<br>explain all parts of the code despite their statement of contribution.<br>10<br><br><br><br></font>
